Three years flip past on the calendar, <br>
The air still carries a hush in the room. <br>
A silence that still folds through the day, <br>
Pressing yesterday on into tomorrow. <br>

I pour coffee, trace the rim with a thumb, <br>
Remebering the weight of your hand. <br>
Steam curls like a question unasked, <br>
The clock keeps its indifferent march. <br>

Outside, leaves turn without permission, <br>
Rivers forget the names of their banks. <br>
Walking the roads, but the map has shifted, <br>
Every corner a mirror, every shadow a ghost. <br>

I keep the door unlatched for echoes, <br>
Let the wind carry hints of your voice. <br>
The ache a tide that learns new shores, <br>
While I learn to swim in its undertow. <br>
