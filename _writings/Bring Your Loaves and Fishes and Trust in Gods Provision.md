In the Gospel, we find this story of provision and faith, a story that resonates with the mission we share as believers. Starting with the feeding of the 5000, we uncover valuable insights that relate to our calling to spread the gospel to a hungry world, and to place our trust in God's abundant provision.

> **Matthew 14:17-20a KJV**  
> *[17] And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.*  
> *[18] He said, Bring them hither to me. *  
> *[19] And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.*  
> *[20] And they did all eat, and were filled: ...*

This story is not just about physical hunger but also a spiritual hunger for the Word of God. Just like the disciples, we are entrusted with a mission to feed the spiritual hunger of those around us. However, we often feel inadequate, even as the disciples with all their provisions.

But remember our role is not to convert or save people. Our role is to bring the message of Christ to the world, to offer the loaves and fishes of His teachings. The outcome is in God's hands, not ours.

In Corinthians the Apostle Paul tells us:

> **1 Corinthians 3:6-7 KJV**  
> *[6] I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.*  
> *[7] So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.*-

We are merely planters and waterers of the seeds of faith. It is God who brings the increase, who feeds the spiritual hunger, and who changes hearts. We must trust in Him and His divine timing.

Our duty is to share the message of salvation, the love of Christ, and His teachings. Just as the disciples brought their small offering to Jesus, we must faithfully bring the gospel to those we encounter.

In Mark Jesus instructs us:

> **Mark 16:15 KJV**  
> *[15] And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.*  

As we heed this divine command, let us remember that our role is to bring the gospel, not to guarantee its acceptance. We might face rejection, indifference, or even hostility, but our faithfulness lies in our obedience to share the good news.

Be encouraged by the story of the feeding of the 5000. You just need to bring the loaves and fishes of the gospel; it's up to God to feed the hearts and souls of people. Trust in His wisdom, His timing, and His grace.

May we be faithful stewards of the gospel message, leaving the results in the hands of our God. It is He who changes lives, and it is He who will bring the increase. Trust in God's ability to perform the miraculous. 

**Amen.**
