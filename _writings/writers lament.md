The hour is late,  
and my thoughts hum.  
Blank screen. Blank page.  
But not a blank mind.

I chase the words  
like fireflies,  
they flicker,  
then vanish when I reach.

Am I imagining them?  
Is the silence just a lie  
I’ve told myself?

I talk it out,  
alone in my own mind,  
conversations  
with the only person  
who always answers back.

(And even that’s debatable.)

Sometimes the words trickle,  
a slow drip from a rusty tap.  
Sometimes they pour  
like a storm that’s been waiting  
all week to break.

I collect what I can.  
Enough to puddle the page.  
Enough to remember  
that I’m still here,  
still writing,  
still thinking,  
still fighting to say  
what I’m afraid no one else  
will ever understand.
