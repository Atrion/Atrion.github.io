One day you will hear I am dead. Don't believe it. I'll be more alive than I have ever been, for I will be with Jesus Christ, my Savior, in the place He has prepared for me.

When the Lord Jesus Christ comes again, He will transform what was once perishable into something glorious and imperishable. My body will be raised, no longer bound by the frailties of this world, and I will stand in His presence, whole and complete.

This hope we have in Jesus Christ is not just about leaving this world behind, it’s about the promise that everything in this life has purpose. God created the physical world and declared it good, and through the Lord Jesus Christ’s resurrection, He affirmed that His plans include redeeming and restoring it all.

Because Jesus Christ rose from the dead, your actions today as a Believer are not meaningless. Every kind word spoken, every act of mercy shown, every moment you spend loving your neighbor, that time with family and friends.

So live today with hope, knowing that the risen Christ transforms everything, our struggles, our efforts, our lives, and gives them eternal significance. Nothing is lost in Him.
