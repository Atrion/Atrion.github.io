Our faith is a journey filled with highs and lows, moments of unwavering trust, and times of doubt. It's something that many, if not all, who are saved can relate to, where we may find ourselves questioning if we are truly holding onto our faith or if we are faltering in our trust in the Lord. This doubt can sometimes stem from feeling unworthy of the incredible gift offered by God, by troubles in our personal lives, or any number of reasons.

What is important to acknowledge is that these feelings, that our faltering is a universal feeling; they are part of our human experience of faith. It does not diminish our devotion, doubt is not a sign of weakness but it is an opportunity for growth. Even the most devoted of believers have grappled with these uncertainties. 

These moments of faltering can be a step towards a deeper, more authentic version of our faith. Embracing our doubts with honesty and seeking to overcome them leads to a stronger relationship with God. The Bible itself is a testament to this, portraying individuals who faced challenges to their faith and yet still found strength and renewal through God.

One way to navigate through these doubtful moments is by turning to the Scriptures. The Bible offers words of wisdom, comfort, and reassurance (among other things) that can serve as an anchor for our faith. For instance, the following reminds us of God's steadfast presence:

> **Psalm 46:1**
> *[46] God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.*

This verse is a comforting reminder that God is with us, offering support and strength in all our times of need, even those times of doubt and faltering.

Prayer, a powerful tool at our disposal, is another way of strengthening our faith. Through prayer, we can express our doubts, fears, and struggles to God, knowing that He hears and understands that which is in our hearts. 

> **Philippians 4:6-7**
> *[6] Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.*
> *[7] And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.*

This passage highlights, and encourages, the peace that comes from entrusting our concerns to God through prayer.

Community, Fellowship and the Assembly, also plays a large vital role in our spiritual journey. Connecting with fellow believers helps to provide support, encouragement, and accountability. 

> **Hebrews 10:24-25**
> *[24] And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:*
> *[25] Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.*

This emphasizes the importance of fellowship. Engaging in our community helps remind us that we are not alone in our struggles and strengthens our faith through our shared experiences.

Lastly, gratitude and reflection both can help bring a deeper trust in God. Taking time to count our blessings and reflect on God's faithfulness in our lives can shift our perspective and help to foster a greater sense of gratitude and trust in His plan.

Our faith is a journey of many paths, with moments of doubt, faltering, and trust all intertwined. It's a journey we all navigate, drawing strength from the Word, prayer, community, and gratitude. These elements remind us that while doubt may arise, and we feel like we might be faltering, that our faith can be strengthened through intentional practices and deepening our relationship with God.

> **Hebrews 11:6**
> *[6] But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.*
