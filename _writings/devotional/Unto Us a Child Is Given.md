> **Isaiah 9:6 KJV** <br>
> *[6] For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.*

Christmas has a way of filling our calendars and our minds. There are meals to plan, people to see, gifts to wrap, and memories that come back whether we ask for them or not. In the middle of all of that, this verse quietly cuts through the noise. It reminds us that at the very centre of our faith is not an event on the calendar, but a Person who was given to us.

“Unto **us** a child is born... unto **us** a son is given.”  
Those little words “unto us” make it personal. The Lord Jesus did not simply arrive in the world as an interesting religious figure; He was given in grace to people who needed Him. To people who were in darkness, confused, tired, guilty, or afraid. To people like you and me.

Isaiah piles up the names and titles of this Child, and each one reaches into a different corner of our lives. He is called **Wonderful**, beyond our full understanding, but never beyond our reach. When life feels tangled and we can’t make sense of it, we are meant to remember that there is more wonder in Christ than there is confusion in our circumstances.

He is the **Counsellor**. Many of us come into this season carrying questions, regrets, or decisions that sit quietly at the back of our minds. The Lord Jesus is not distant from those things. He knows how to guide, how to comfort, and how to correct. His wisdom is gentle, but it is not weak. Sitting with His Word open and our hearts honest before Him is still the safest place for a restless mind.

He is **The mighty God**. That title sits beside the manger and reminds us that the One who lay there in weakness is the same One who upholds the universe. When we feel small, overlooked, or worn down, we are not resting on our own strength. The One we trust is able to keep us, to carry us through another year, and to finish the work He has begun.

He is **The everlasting Father**, not that He replaces the Father, but that He shows the same eternal care and character. In a world where so much feels temporary and fragile, He remains constant. Homes change, health changes, relationships change, but He does not. His love is not seasonal; it does not appear for December and fade in January. He is the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.

And He is **The Prince of Peace**. That does not mean life suddenly becomes quiet on the outside. Many hearts come to Christmas with empty chairs at the table, unresolved tensions, or private anxieties. The peace He gives is not pretending those things don’t exist. It is a deep, steady calm that comes from knowing who holds the government on His shoulder, and who holds us as well. His peace is meant to shape how we speak to one another, how quickly we forgive, and how patiently we love.

So as this Christmas day passes, whatever it looks like for you this year, may we lift our eyes beyond the decorations and the schedule to the One who was given. May we worship Him with thankful hearts, let His counsel steady us, and allow His peace to reach into the busy and the quiet parts of our lives.

I hope everyone who reads this has a truly joyful Christmas, and that the Lord Himself will be very near.
