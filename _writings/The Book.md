A throne of white,  
No place to hide.  
The Judge is set,  
The sea gives tide.  

The books are opened,  
Each life made known,  
No voice defends,  
Each stands alone.  

But one book shines,  
A page of grace.  
A name found there,  
A soul made safe.  

O sinner, hear.  
The time is brief.  
This book holds names  
Bought by belief.  

Is yours there now?  
Be sure. Be wise.  
Before that day,  
Before time dies.
