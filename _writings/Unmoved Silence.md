Unmoved Silence  

The air hangs low, pressing hard against my chest.  
Shadows spread across rooms once filled with light.  
The smallest sound feels distant and slow.  

Time moves uneven, dragging the body behind it.  
Each step falls flat, without promise of arrival.  
The hours stretch wider than the heart can hold.  

Nothing shatters, yet nothing feels secure.  
The silence thickens, steady and unbroken.  
A weight remains, patient and unwilling to move.
