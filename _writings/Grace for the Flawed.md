No burden is too heavy for Jesus to carry with you, and no distance is too great for the Father’s love to reach. In every weakness, He gives strength; in every failure, He offers forgiveness. Christ brings hope where there is despair and healing where there is brokenness. The same Lord who restored others can restore you. His grace is greater than every sin and every storm.
