I walked my own road,  
Hands in my pockets,  
Head full of my own will.  
Desire was king,  
And I bowed freely.

Then came the Light.  
It didn’t scold me;  
it changed me.

The path behind still open,  
No longer wanting its charms.  
Now I walk forward,  
Sometimes stumbling,  
Often weary,  
But never alone.

Temptation doesn’t disappear;  
It sharpens,  
Tries harder to call me back.  
But I am not who I was.  
And He is still who He is.

So I place my faith; all of it,  
In the hands that held nails.  
I let Him light my way,  
I follow.  
Not perfectly.  
But faithfully.

And that,  
I’ve learned,  
Is enough.
