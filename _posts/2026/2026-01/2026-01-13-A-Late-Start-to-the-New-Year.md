First post of the new year... only a few weeks late. 😬

So far 2026 has been going well, or at least I don’t have anything worth complaining about. I’m sure I could *find* something if I really tried, but for now I’ll spare us both and just catch things up a bit.

## House-Sitting, Pets, and Bird Art

The end of last year and the very start of this one were spent **house and pet sitting** for a man who currently works with my dad and brother. He and his wife were heading west to spend Christmas with their kids, and I was left in charge of the house, two small dogs, one cat, and what felt like half the birds in western PEI.

The dogs were excellent company, friendly, well–behaved, and always happy to join me on the couch.

  <p style="font-size:0.9rem; margin-top:0.4rem;">
    The cat is antisocial, so this is the best you’re getting. No cat photos. 😄
  </p>
</div>

The cat and I had an understanding: I didn’t push my luck, and it didn’t scratch me. That seemed fair.

Outside, there were **about eight bird feeders** scattered around the lot, plus a whole collection of **handmade bird houses**. The owner is a bit of an artist, and you can tell, everything from the feeders to the little “bird condos” and art installations around the yard had his fingerprints all over them.

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 1.1rem 0;">
  <img src="/assets/images/2026/2026-01-13/2026-01-13-photo002.gif" alt="Animated view of bird houses around the yard" style="max-width:40%; height:auto;" />
  <p style="font-size:0.9rem; margin-top:0.4rem;">

On the porch, he had a homemade **chime/gong** setup that sounded incredible. The short video I captured on my phone doesn’t do it justice. I found myself wishing I’d brought my studio mic over just to record that sound properly.

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 1.1rem 0;">
  <video controls style="max-width:20%; height:auto;">

  <p style="font-size:0.9rem; margin-top:0.4rem;">
    The homemade “gong” on the porch, the mic doesn’t quite capture how rich it sounded in person.
  </p>
</div>

There’s something strangely calming about a deep, resonant chime rolling across a quiet yard.

## Christmas at Home

Even though I was staying elsewhere, **Christmas Day** itself was spent at home. All my siblings and their children were able to make it up, which meant a full living room, plenty of noise, and wrapping paper everywhere.

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 1.1rem 0;">
  <a href="/assets/images/2026/2026-01-13/2026-01-13-photo005.jpg">

  </a>
  <p style="font-size:0.9rem; margin-top:0.4rem;">
    Christmas Day at home, full house, full hearts, and plenty of wrapping paper.
  </p>
</div>

Christmas feels more enjoyable again now that there are little ones around. Both my nephews are pretty adorable, if I’m allowed to say that. I think this might have been the first time I actually held my nephew Beau. I tend to be a bit cautious with babies until they reach that *“less breakable”* stage of life. 😂

</div>

## Christmas Supper at the Hall

We also had a **large Christmas supper** at the hall, a free meal for the community. I think we had around **135 people** come through. Those who do the cooking at the hall outdid themselves yet again: a full Christmas dinner, all the fixings, and then more desserts than anyone truly needed (not that I turned any of them down).

Alongside the meal, we had a short **Gospel message**. We invited **Peter Ramsay** (<https://heaven4sure.com/>) to come and speak. Afterward, we sang some Christian Christmas hymns together. Hearing that many voices singing familiar truth at once was something special.

Somewhere in the middle of all that, I managed to get a photo with **Miss Anna**, which automatically made the day better.

## A Gift That Felt Like Family

Outside of family, I only received one Christmas gift: which I never expect, but always appreciate.

This one came from the **MacKenzie family**. Technically that makes it a gift from “outside” the family, but in reality they’re like family to me anyway. They gave me a **nice suit coat and dress shirt**. I think it fits properly, it bunches a little oddly at the shoulder, but I suspect that’s more me not being used to it than any design problem.

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 1.1rem 0;">
  <a href="/assets/images/2026/2026-01-13/2026-01-13-photo009.jpg">

  </a>
  <p style="font-size:0.9rem; margin-top:0.4rem;">
    Christmas antlers, and some of the MacKenzie crew.

It was one of those thoughtful, practical gifts that also quietly says, *“We see you, and we care.”* I’m thankful for them.

<br>

## A Quiet New Year’s Eve

New Year’s itself was quiet.

I was still house-sitting, and spent the evening more or less alone, some chatting online with a few people, but no big celebration. I didn’t even bother to find a proper countdown on TV this year. It’s a bit different when you mark midnight by yourself.

Still, there were specific people I wanted to wish a happy new year to, and I made sure to do that. Sometimes a couple of sincere messages mean more than a noisy party.

<br>

## Engagements, Showers, and Slideshows

In our little Gospel Hall community, there have been **two engagements** recently, which means **wedding showers**.

The first shower was for **Titus and Tori**, university-aged, young, and they seem like they fit together very well. Along with a French press I bought them as a gift, I put together a **slideshow** with photos and some gentle background music for the event.

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 1.1rem 0;">
  <a href="/assets/images/2026/2026-01-13/2026-01-13-photo011.jpg">

  </a>
  <p style="font-size:0.9rem; margin-top:0.4rem;">
    Titus and Tori.
  </p>
</div>

The second shower was for **Justin and Charlotte**. I did a similar slideshow for them, this time using some instrumental hymn music as the soundtrack. For a gift, I opted for money in a card. They have some big moves coming up, and I figured they’d need flexibility more than more “stuff.”

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 1.1rem 0;">
  <a href="/assets/images/2026/2026-01-13/2026-01-13-photo012.jpg">

  </a>
  <p style="font-size:0.9rem; margin-top:0.4rem;">

  </p>
</div>

I’m no professional, and things were simple, but I enjoy putting these little things together. It’s one small way to contribute to days that matter.

<br>

## A Few Favourite Photos

These next shots are in here mostly because I like how they turned out.

While I was still house-sitting, there were a couple of **early mornings** where the sunrise across the road was just right, colours layered over the snow and trees in that quiet, winter way.

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 1.1rem 0;">
  <a href="/assets/images/2026/2026-01-13/2026-01-13-photo013.jpg">

  </a>
  <p style="font-size:0.9rem; margin-top:0.4rem;">
    Early morning light - one of the perks of house-sitting.

</div>

Sometimes the camera catches what the heart is trying to say better than words can.

<br>

## Hosting for a Change

One unexpected blessing of this house-sitting stretch was the chance to **host**, which is something I don’t get to do very often.

I had the **Wilson family** over twice, just for snacks and coffee. We sat around the kitchen, talked for hours, and laughed a lot. The Wilsons sometimes attend the hall: Sunday school for the younger ones, Bible study for the oldest sister, Sophie. They’re a lively clan, and the conversations were a mix of serious and silly in the best way.

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 1.1rem 0;">
  <a href="/assets/images/2026/2026-01-13/2026-01-13-photo016.jpg">

  </a>
  <p style="font-size:0.9rem; margin-top:0.4rem;">
    Coffee, snacks, and a kitchen full of Wilsons.

I’m not naturally a social butterfly, but moments like that remind me how good it is to have people around the table.

## Tatamagouche Days Meeting

On **January 3–4**, I was able to travel to the **Tatamagouche Days Meeting** with my friend Josh. He also brought along another young man from the Pope Road Gospel Hall.

We spent the afternoon of the 3rd at the **Elliot’s** home, sitting around talking, playing some video games (I’ve discovered I’m very rusty), and then finishing with some excellent homemade pizza.

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 1.1rem 0;">

  <p style="font-size:0.9rem; margin-top:0.4rem;">
    Time at the Elliots’ conversation, games, and really good pizza.

The Tatamagouche hall arranged a **two-hour skate**. I went mostly to socialise and catch up with people. (Yes, I voluntarily went somewhere with a crowd, I’m still a little surprised at myself.)

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 1.1rem 0;">
  <a href="/assets/images/2026/2026-01-13/2026-01-13-photo019.jpg">

  </a>
</div>

After the skate, the **McClellands** hosted a hymn sing and snack at their home.

I’ve grown to really enjoy the hymn sings. I can’t sing well at all, but there’s no shortage of good singers around me, and the words themselves do a lot of the heavy lifting. The snacks don’t hurt either. I’ve yet to meet a Christian family that isn’t dangerously good at cooking. It’s a blessing... and hard on the waistline.

  <p style="font-size:0.9rem; margin-top:0.4rem;">
    Hymns, snacks, and fellowship, hard to beat that combination.
  </p>
</div>

Sunday started with the **morning meeting at Pugwash Junction Gospel Hall**, where **Sam Levy** gave the closing message. I stayed overnight at his place.. I’m always grateful for Sam, his wife, and for their son who gave up his bed so I’d have one.

From there we went on to Tatamagouche for an afternoon of ministry and then a closing Gospel meeting. The ministry was rich and thought–provoking. I won’t try to recap it all here, but if that sort of thing interests you, the audio is available here:

## A Baptism at the Hall

This past Sunday we had a **baptism** at our own hall, the third one (including my own) since I started attending.

It’s always a wonderful sight to see believers publicly declare themselves followers of Christ and His teaching through the symbolic act of **believer’s baptism**. Going under the water and rising again as a picture of being buried with Christ and raised with Him, publicly, in front of family, friends, and a full room of witnesses.

All three who were baptised had a crowd there to support them. No photos of the actual baptism, unfortunately, but earlier that morning before Sunday school I did get some pictures with Miss Anna and a couple of squishy little friends named **Pickles** and **Peanut**.

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 1.1rem 0;">

## Cassettes, History, and Old Ministry

As I write this, I’m also working away at digitising **cassette tapes** and finishing off the last of the documents from that **Glenwood history box** I mentioned far too long ago. The holidays took a toll on my efficiency, and the backlog is finally coming due.

Recently, one of the women from the hall loaned me a **large tub of cassettes**, recordings from her and her late husband’s collection. I’ve sorted them out and started the slow process of digitising them for the Gospel site. Based on the labels, there’s a lot of good ministry there that I haven’t heard before.

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 1.1rem 0;">
  <a href="/assets/images/2026/2026-01-13/2026-01-13-photo027.jpg">

  </a>
  <p style="font-size:0.9rem; margin-top:0.4rem;">
    A tub full of old cassette ministry, slow work, but worth preserving.

It’s time-consuming work, but there’s something deeply worthwhile about preserving these things. Voices that would otherwise fade into storage boxes get a second life in digital form.

## A Few Things That Need to Happen This Year

Call it a **New Year’s resolution** if you like, but I’ve told myself there are a few things that simply **need** to be done this year. Unlike the usual resolutions, I’m not giving myself permission to quit. I may falter, but I want to keep going even when it doesn’t go smoothly.

A short, imperfect list:

- **Use my traveller’s notebook more** — I was given one for Christmas, and I’d like to actually make use of it instead of letting it become another decorative item on a shelf.  
- **Be more intentional in my walk with God** — less coasting, more deliberate time in prayer and in the Word, not just when it’s convenient.  
- **Get back on top of my diet and weight loss** — if I could lose even half as much as I did last year, I’d be in a range I’d feel more comfortable with.  
- **Stay more up to date with both websites** — this personal site and the Gospel site have both been somewhat neglected. That has to change.  
- **Finish Pilgrim’s Progress** — I’ve started it, I’m enjoying it, and I’d like to actually reach the end, not just talk about how good the part I’ve read is.  

On top of that, **next Sunday** I’m up to give a **Gospel message** again. So I need to prepare for that too. Thankfully, the Lord helps with that, if I were left entirely to myself, I know it wouldn’t get done.

So that more or less brings things up to date.

I should post a bit more regularly, we’ll see how that goes. For now, this is where life stands: a mix of ordinary days, small encouragements, ongoing projects, and a gracious God who keeps giving me both work to do and people to walk alongside while I do it.

From Gravel Hill, that’s plenty for one update.
