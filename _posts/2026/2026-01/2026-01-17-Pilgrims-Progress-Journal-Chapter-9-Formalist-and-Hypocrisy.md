Not long after leaving the sleepers behind, Christian discovers that danger on the road doesn’t always look lazy or careless. Sometimes it looks very religious.

### Formalist and Hypocrisy  

Two men, **Formalist** and **Hypocrisy**, suddenly appear beside Christian. They have not come through the **Wicket Gate**; instead, they have climbed over the wall. They are dressed like pilgrims and speak easily about their religion, but they have never actually entered by the way God has appointed.  

When Christian questions them, they are offended that he should be so “narrow.” They point to their customs, their upbringing, and the traditions of their country as proof that they are as good as anyone else on the road. Christian, however, has learned something they have not: it is not enough to look like a pilgrim, or to walk with pilgrims, if you have never come to Christ Himself.  

Their path may run alongside his for a while, but unless they enter by the Door, their journey cannot end in life.  

**John 10:1 (KJV)**  
> [1] Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.  

True faith enters by Christ, not by self-made religion.
