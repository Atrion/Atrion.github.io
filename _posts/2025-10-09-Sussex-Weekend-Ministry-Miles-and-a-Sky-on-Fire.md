This past weekend was the **Sussex Fall Conference**, and though I’ve made the trip before, each time carries its own rhythm, different faces, familiar roads, and the same gentle reminder that fellowship and faith can recharge a weary spirit in ways no solitary effort can.  

Justin, Jared, and I started off early Saturday morning, driving through a landscape wrapped in a faint gold light, road rolling out in front of us. We missed the first speaker (we were cutting it close from the start), but the drive itself made up for it, quiet stretches of countryside and that particular New Brunswick light that makes even pasture fences feel like a painting. There’s something about long drives to a place of worship that feels right, almost like a small pilgrimage of its own.

We were initially supposed to stay in the dorms at Kingswood University, where the conference was held in the **Irving Chapel**, but were reassigned last-minute to the **Fairway Inn**, conveniently attached to **JJ’s Diner**. I’ve stayed there the last couple of years, it’s not luxurious, but it’s comfortable, and the breakfast is the kind that sets a tone for the day: eggs, bacon, sausage, and strong coffee, and it’s only 5–10 minutes to the chapel.

The meetings were well attended, lots of folks from O’Leary were in Sussex, so our home assembly would’ve felt a little thin. The ministry over the weekend was both encouraging and convicting. It reminded me of what I often call the “conference high,” that spiritual surge that pushes you to rededicate your time, energy, and focus to the Lord. The challenge, of course, comes later, once you return home, unpack, and settle back into normal life. That’s where the high fades, and the real test of consistency begins.  

The audio recordings are available here for anyone interested:

The tech setup this year was impressive. I spent a bit of time chatting with the operators, admiring their workflow. It’s the kind of thing that gets my mind spinning with ideas on how to improve our own hall’s setup, how to streamline recordings and broadcasts, how to better serve those who can’t attend in person.

After the last ministry session on Sunday afternoon, we decided to head back toward the Island but made a quick stop in **Moncton**, where the gospel hall was holding an evening Gospel meeting and supper. I’ve heard they’ve been seeing large turnouts; nearly 200 people from over 20 countries. That kind of diversity in attendance is remarkable, and it’s proof that the Gospel truly reaches across all borders.  

The supper was simple but hearty (lasagna and salad), and I found myself deep in conversation with speaker of the night **Leslie Craig** and then later on their tech lead, one of those spontaneous, nerdy chats about soundboards, mixers, and technological tools. He mentioned a translation app he has been working on as well as a few items they’ve been using that might fit our needs in O’Leary. If we can ever get some extra funds, I’d love to bring a few of those upgrades home.

When we stepped outside that night, the sky was absolutely ablaze, the last light catching on low clouds. I tweaked the photo’s colours a bit, but honestly, the real thing needed no help.

We arrived back in O’Leary late Sunday night, tired but content. Before heading home, I stopped by the hall to grab the audio recordings and power down the equipment. I didn’t even think about editing until Monday morning. That day was filled with all things audio, cleaning up the recordings from O’Leary’s Gospel meeting, the O'Leary Philippines Zoom session, and the Sussex Conference. It’s methodical work, but oddly calming. There’s a satisfaction in knowing that each file will soon reach someone who couldn’t be there in person.

Tuesday brought me back to the office for some bookkeeping. I won’t bore anyone with the details, but the rhythm of invoices and reconciliations has its own quiet reward. Every day I pick up a little more, and every day I shave a few minutes off my time, proof that learning, even slow learning, counts for something. I joked with myself that I might need to ask for a raise, though that might just earn me another pile of receipts instead.

Meanwhile, the **Pugwash Junction Gospel Hall** has been hosting a series of evening ministry meetings with **John Meekin**. My friend Sam, Pugwash’s main tech guy, has been running into issue after issue with the livestream. We’ve all been there: when something that worked flawlessly yesterday suddenly breaks tonight with no explanation. I tried offering what advice I could, but thankfully, Steve (who’s taught me most of what I know) stepped in with some solutions. Hopefully, tonight’s session runs smoothly. There’s nothing quite like that tension of trying to fix a live problem while the meeting keeps rolling.

These past few days have been a blur of travel, cables, and conversations, but they’ve been good. They’ve reminded me that while projects, audio gear, and planning all have their place, the heart of it all is still simple: **faith, fellowship, and focus**. The Lord can use even the smallest contributions, be it running a camera, adjusting a mic, or cleaning up an audio track, to reach hearts in ways we may never see.

If there’s one thing I took from the weekend, it’s this: keep serving where you can, stay faithful when you can’t, and trust that the Lord will fill the rest.

Thanks for reading. Until next time, may we all hold fast to what we’ve heard, and live it out when the “conference high” fades.
