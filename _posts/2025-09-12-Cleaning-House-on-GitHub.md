Every now and then I hit that point where the digital clutter builds up too much and it needs a proper cleaning. This past week I finally turned my attention to GitHub, which I’ve been neglecting for years. It’s been a graveyard of old forks, abandoned projects, and random experiments that no longer served any purpose.  

So, I took the plunge: deleted what wasn’t worth keeping, archived the projects that were finished but still had some value, and updated what might still have a future. It felt good to pare things back to what actually matters.

Along the way I reorganized things by shifting several repositories into organizations under my account. It keeps everything tidier and makes permissions easier to manage. I even added a profile readme and cleaned up some global settings, small touches, but they make the account look less like a junk drawer.  

There’s still more to do. My stars list is a mountain of things I clicked on “for later” and never revisited. At some point I’ll need to prune those, but for now I’ll let it sit. The bigger issue has been trying to breathe life into projects from years ago. Many of them are riddled with broken links, built on software that’s now deprecated, or missing any trace of a readme. And since I’ve never been much of a coder, my documentation habits were almost non-existent. Coming back to them now feels like reading someone else’s half-finished puzzle.  

Still, the process reminded me of where I started, what I tried, and where I might want to go. Even in the mess there’s value. Sometimes cleaning house isn’t just about throwing things away, it’s about rediscovering what you’ve already done and deciding what’s worth building on.
