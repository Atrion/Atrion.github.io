It’s been a semi productive stretch, and one of the steps I’ve taken was registering the domain **fromgravelhill.ca**. It’ll serve as the central hub for my various projects going forward. This blog now lives at **[blog.fromgravelhill.ca](https://blog.fromgravelhill.ca)**, and the tentative replacement for *The Glorious Gospel* has found a home at **[gospel.fromgravelhill.ca](https://gospel.fromgravelhill.ca)**.

I ended up using a registrar I hadn’t dealt with before, I picked them based on some decent Reddit reviews. They don’t seem any worse than ones I’ve used in the past, so we’ll see how that pans out long-term. Their price was right for what I needed.

On the hardware side, my new **24-inch monitor** showed up. I know that's not huge by today’s standards, but coming from a 15–17" laptop screen and portable screen, it feels massive. There’s no adjustment on the base though, which is frustrating. Thankfully, the angle it defaults to isn’t bad, so for now it’ll do.

I've been toying with the idea of mounting the **mini PC** directly to the back of the monitor. I don’t think heat would be a problem, but I'd need a bracket or mount of some sort. Might try to **design a custom piece** and see if my sister can 3D print it for me.

With the domain in place, I’ve also been working on a **landing page** for the whole setup. Just something simple that will direct people to the various sub-sites and projects I manage. Once that’s done, I think I’ll try designing **logos for each sub-site**, keeping a **consistent style** across the board. Something clean and minimal that still reflects the theme of each project.

On a more organizational note, I’ve started cleaning up my **email setup**, getting things forwarded properly and consolidating accounts. Next step: updating my signature and **re-verifying my PGP keys**.

Truth is, my online presence has become pretty fragmented. A bit neglected, honestly. It's time to bring it all under one roof and start fresh. Things have been scattered for too long.

One step at a time.
