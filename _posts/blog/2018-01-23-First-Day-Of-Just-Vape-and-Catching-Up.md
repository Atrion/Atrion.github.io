  Today is My first official day of using solely just the Vape and no Cigarettes. 
  
  For the most part it feels fine. I find the way you inhale with the vape is slightly different than a Cigarette so it takes a little getting used to.
  
  There is also the taste, I have tried 3 different tobacco flavored e-Liquids and none really have that taste I am looking for, but they seem close enough, and the Nicotine is the more important part.
  
  I currently am at 16mg Nicotine but hope to soon get that down.
  
  Aside from that the New MiBand 2 Arrived so I've been swapping out my software on my phone for recording exercise, food and health.
  
  The Last few weeks I have slipped back and put back on a few more pounds than I care for so hopefully I can start getting that back under control.
  
  Today I'm also trying to get caught back up on my 365 posts, Most of them I already have wrote just not input on here so that should go rather quick.
