  So What can I say, This post same as the last post. Lack of Wanting to do it, and well sometimes just forgetting about it.
  
  I have a habit with all old blogs and journals and whatever sites I have used, I grow tired of them or forget about them. Go months without an update, and then usually just pop in to say hey long time.
  
  I hope to try and break this cycle. But so far I'm heading the same.
  
  In the Meantime I have been playing around with Minetest, a free Minecraft alternative. As well as setting up an OpenSim Grid on my Raspberry Pi Server. (OpenSim is the Open-source Version on Secondlife)
