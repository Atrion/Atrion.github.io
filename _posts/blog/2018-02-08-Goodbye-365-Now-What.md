  Well that didn't last very long. I wasn't getting what I wanted out of this 365 challenge thing and I kept putting it aside or forgetting about it completely.

  So I'm moving on from it, instead of trying to force myself into it I will find something else to achieve what I wanted.
  
  In the Meantime, Quitting Smoking is going not to bad, just over 2 weeks using only the Vape device no cigarettes. I still have a nicotine liquid but its a step in the right direction.
  
  I've installed a number of different health and quantified self programs on my phone to help track my day to day life as well as health, it seems to be working well. I am trying to stick to apps that push info back to just 1 or 2 places to make things easier, Mainly Google Fit.
