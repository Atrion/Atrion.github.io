The heat… it's been unrelenting this week. Temperatures hovering in the low 30s, and with the humidity it feels even higher. My upstairs room in this old house holds onto the warmth, despite the fan doing its best, 29 to 30 degrees seems to be the best I can get.

Saturday evening I pushed myself harder than usual, a 30km bike ride out to O'Leary. I stopped at the hall for a water refill, then took a short break with friends before heading home. It nearly doubled my typical distance, and while I pedaled, I kept the **[Practicology Podcast](https://www.practicologypodcast.com/)** playing. It’s become a reliable companion for the longer rides, encouraging, sound, and filled with Scriptural insight.

This Sunday I’ve been asked to speak in the Gospel. I’m working through it now, praying for clarity and courage. I still struggle with confidence, but I do it because of the message itself, I believe it, and I believe people need to hear it. With God’s help, I’ll get through it.

I’m leaning toward a more serious tone this time. The reality is, many don’t consider the need for salvation because they haven’t considered the consequence of rejecting it. It’s not always comfortable to speak plainly about death or eternity, but sometimes clarity is what awakens conviction.

I don’t yet know who else is speaking, but I’m hoping it’s someone flexible who can follow after. I do best when I go first, planned and prepared, and someone else can round it out.

On another note, I submitted both a poem and an article for the upcoming **RED** Christmas issue. No word yet on whether they’ll be accepted, but I’m hopeful. Two weeks ago, a small piece I wrote on the importance of knowing our neighbours was published in **The West Prince Graphic** Letter to the Editor section. I sent in another this week, but haven’t heard anything back. Maybe another time.

Poetry’s been calling again, nothing major, just fragments and finished pieces here and there. I’m toying with the idea of gathering it all together and printing a small book through Amazon’s print-on-demand. Realistically, I don’t expect anyone to buy it, but I think I’d like to see my own book on my own shelf. That alone would be worth it.

Another thought that’s been on my mind, a site that was a great help to me before I was saved, and even more so afterward, was [The Glorious Gospel](https://www.thegloriousgospel.ca/). Sadly, after 13 faithful years, the creator decided to bring that work to a close. He had considered passing it on, but ultimately felt it was time to step away. I understand his decision, though I’m disappointed to see it end. I've begun discussions with the Oversight at the O'Leary Gospel Hall about possibly adding a section to our website ([olearygospelhall.ca](https://olearygospelhall.ca/)) to carry forward the spirit of that effort. And if that isn’t the direction we go, I’m prepared to create something similar myself.

Anyway, back to melting in this heat and trying to pull more thoughts together. And if you *are* reading this, I’d love to hear from you. Maybe drop me an email and let me know.
