The bookkeeping is officially caught up.

Three weeks of (semi-)solid focus and effort brought the entire previous year up to datem along with a bit of housekeeping along the way. I’m grateful for the opportunity, especially considering how new I was to this. It helped that someone was brought in on two separate days to show me the ropes, and it made all the difference. Now that the heavy lifting is done, I’ll be shifting to just a few days a month to stay on top of things. It should be a much easier pace than the sprint I just finished. I look forward to getting better at it, step by step.

The auction items have been dealt with. Well, mostly. I still have a stack of books I don’t want and no clear idea of what to do with them. A few will likely end up in the local “little libraries,” but the rest? Not sure yet. For now, they’re boxed up and tucked away, out of sight, at least.

I finally got around to setting up the new bed. I bought it before everything in my life changed near the end of 2022, and it sat untouched in the basement until now. My back had enough of the old mattress, so I assembled the frame and let the compressed mattress expand. I’m so glad I did. It’s already better to sleep on, and while it hasn’t cured the sleeplessness, it hasn’t made things worse either, small wins matter.

My Gospel speaking appointment has been bumped around a couple of times, between visiting speakers and full schedules, the date keeps shifting. I don’t mind, really. If it gets pushed later, I’m fine. It’s when things move *closer* that it throws me off. Hah.

Friday night, I made a trip to Pugwash with David, who’s been speaking in a Gospel series there. They’re holding it in the local firehall in hopes of attracting folks who might not otherwise attend. Sam had asked me to come over and run through the video setup again. I showed him and his backup crew how to do what they needed, along with a few audio tips. Recording outside your usual space always comes with quirks.

This past week, the bike saw a bit less use, heat and laziness teamed up on me. Still, the weight’s down another 2 lbs. Lately it’s been somewhere between 0 and 4 lbs each week, but down or even holding steady is still better than up.

This week, I need to push ahead with the *Glorious Gospel* website (Possible new name incoming). I’ve been meaning to upload more of the archived content and reach out to a few people who previously contributed. I’d love to see if they’re open to sharing new or past items for the new site.

I’m also behind (though not drastically) on some photo editing, for history related projects and this site. Something else to chip away at.

The new PC has been working well, as expected. I’m already running low on storage again, no surprise there. A new monitor is on the way, and I’ve been getting used to the 60% keyboard. It’s growing on me. Once that’s sorted, I’ll need to check over the laptop files and see about doing a full reset.

I also took a chance and ordered some leather from Amazon. I’m hoping to make a new leather cover for one of my books. It might not be great quality, but if nothing else, it’ll make for good practice. Best case? It’s usable for the real thing. Fingers crossed.

Until the last word and first light…
(I know not a great signoff, but its a work in progress)
