Trying to keep up and clear the clutter, physically and mentally. Today’s been one of those day's of playing catch-up with the random list of to-dos that always seems to grow faster than it shrinks.

First up was some bike maintenance. I pulled the rear tire off to adjust the bearings, its been a little loose. But the real headache is the pedal arm bolt. It’s been coming loose nearly every ride, and while I’ve been tightening it with an Allen key every time, it’s finally starting to strip. That’ll be fun to replace...

Meal prep got done as well, nothing elaborate, just boiled eggs, some chicken and bacon, and a few freezer bags of food for the days ahead. I’ve strayed a little from the strict carnivore approach lately, but I’m still down 4 lbs this week, so I’m not worried. Skipping lunches while head-down in accounting probably didn’t hurt either. Small wins.

With laundry going in the background, I’ve also been working on still setting up the new PC. The file transfer from my laptop hasn’t been as smooth as I hoped. Turns out my once tidy storage habits have fallen into chaos. I used to be so strict about folder systems and naming conventions. Time to rebuild some of those old habits while I settle into the new system.

As for the old laptop that I pulled files off for one of the elders at the hall, I’ve got Debian Linux running on it now with an 80GB drive. It works well enough, but it’s not worth selling and I’ve no use for it at the moment, so it’s tucked away in the storage room for now.

Speaking of storage, I recently picked up my auction boxes of miscellaneous electronics and a box of books from my siblings during a family meal. A few more good titles than I expected were in there, so that was a pleasant surprise. I paid so little it wouldn’t have mattered anyway. As for the rest, I might see if any family want the extras or drop some in the two little free libraries I know of nearby.

The electronics box, however... had a lot more junk than treasure. I might’ve slightly overpaid for what it turned out to be, but it wasn’t much money and it was worth the curiosity. Who knows, there may be a hidden gem in there yet.

I’ve also been uploading Gospel conference audio files to archive.org for better storage and easier sharing through the Glorious Gospel site. That site still needs a lot of work, but I’m starting to chipping away at it bit by bit.

There are just so many projects I get excited about starting... I really need to focus on actually finishing a few. I still have some local history materials on loan from Audrey MacDonald that I haven’t sorted out yet either, really need to take care of that before she starts wondering where they’ve gone.

Anyway, signing off for now. Let’s see how much I can knock off the list in the days ahead.
