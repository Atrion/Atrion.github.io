  About half a year or so ago I set a personal goal for myself to loose 50 pounds, I didn't;t set a timeframe, but I knew it was something I wanted to do when before it had only been something I needed to do, which is why I laced the motivation.
  
  I downloaded a few apps to my phone to help track my food intake and my exercise, I got a fit bit knockoff to help make my results more accurate. It was hard, giving up some foods and drinks I enjoyed but were horrible for me. Now I don't mean to say I don't have any sweets or chocolates, I am human, I will have some desert or a chocolate bar sometimes, but I don't eat anywhere near what I had been. Sometimes I slip and sometimes I do very good, Its and up and down path.
  
  Just before xmas I finally reached my goal, I had lost 50 lbs. I didn't;t feel as tired anymore and was eating much healthier. It was a great feeling to have set that goal and made it, and I have not set a new goal as I need to loose a little more.
  
  Since that day the holidays have happened, and then a period of me not wanting to do much of anything so I have slipped back some more. I have noticed it though and have made some corrections and am hopefully on my way again.
