  Could my life be better, sure it could. Could it be worse, You bet ya. But am I content?
  
  Yes.
  
  But since this is something to help increase my writing perhaps I should elaborate even just a little.
  
  If I sit and think about it I can find many things that I would like or wish were better, or things that I hope don't get worse or even horrible, but the fact is with where I am in my life, the person I am with, the place I live, my family, what I can afford to have I am Content.
  
  Now that's not to say I wont continue to try and make my life and my self better, but for now things are Good.
