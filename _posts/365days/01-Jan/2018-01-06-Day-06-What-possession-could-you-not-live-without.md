  Sadly the answer to this is most probably either my phone or laptop. Now I use both a lot (a lot a lot) but I'm not one of those people with my phone constantly in my hand scrolling through the screens.
  
  My Phone and my laptop though are where all my none physically life exists. Photos, writings, passwords, everything that I use on a day to day basis to make life easier and/or more enjoyable.
  
  If push came to shove I'm sure I could give them up, but in a world where I don't need to survive without them then  I will use them.
