  Well not much beyond the normal for me and mine really happened this year but to pick the best would have to be last year at the end of march.
  
  Last year was Mine and My other halfs anniversary 10 years of being together, we went away for the weekend, got ourselves a hotel room in another town. Walked around town, tried out some new food and places we don't get to frequent.
  
  We had drinks in the hotel room, ordered some room service (Always gotta treat yourself when at a hotel) laid back and watched some movies, Enjoying our time together celebrating how long we have been together, looking forward to what is still yet to come.
