  My Goal of this year is to End Smoking Cigarettes.
  
  I started smoking about 12 or 13 years ago for no real reason other than I was around it a lot and it was something to do. From there it became an addiction.
  
  Ive tried quitting a few times before but never for very long. This time I'm hoping to have an easier time with the aid of a Vape Product.
  
  My Sisters for Christmas Purchased me an Aspire Premium Kit, which included the Aspire Mini Nautilus. I've picked up a Tobacco Flavored Eliquid containig the recomended dose of Nicotine from the Shop. Since Christmas I have been smoking the Vape as well as Cigarettes, From there I will move to just the Vape.
  
  Once I'm using just the Vape Device I hope to slowly bring the nicotine levels down to 0, at which point I should be able to stope vaping as well.
  
  I'm Looking out at it positive and have the faith in myself to accomplish this, It may be a slow journey but well worth it.
