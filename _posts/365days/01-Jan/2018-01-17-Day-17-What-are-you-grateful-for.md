  I'm Greatful really for all that I have. Sometimes I complain, or bitch about this or that, but when it comes down to it I know that I have it a fair bit better than others.
  
  I might loose sight of it sometimes when things dont go the way I would like or hope, but I am grateful for everything from the Woman I am with to the food we eat or the car and phone and computers and all other possessions that we use on a daily basis.
