  Well Lately I have tried to have a bunch of Good things to eat, Both Good as in Healthy and Tasting (Which is usually the one I favor).
  
  The Last good thing though I would say was probably yesterday when Myself and my other half spend most of the day thawing, Prepping and cooking a large turkey. Large turkey baked in the over, stuffed with a healthy store bough stuffing mix with some sausage added. 
  
  We prepared the large bird to freeze for several meals down the road but last nights stuffy with turkey and some spicy seasoned potato wedges tasted so good, and according to my food tracking app was actually decently healthy as well.
