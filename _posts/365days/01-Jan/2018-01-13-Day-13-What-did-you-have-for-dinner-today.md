  Todays Meal was a long day of prep thawing and preparing a turkey for roasting. Some boxed stuffing mixed with some mushrooms and sausage, roasted inside the bird. Warmed the Apt up on this cold day, and the smell had us wanting to eat it well before the dish was done.
  
  This meal was great and since the bird was a decent size it made enough for 3 maybe 4 more meals for the two of us.
