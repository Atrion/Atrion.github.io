With this blog being public facing, I know that anyone could potentially read it. It’s an odd concept to be sure. I'm trying not to let that affect what I write or don’t write here. My goal is to be open and transparent with my thought process, both the good and the bad.

Still, it crosses my mind now and then that it might feel strange knowing others could read about my insecurities and personal moments. But it is what it is. If I’m going to be open, then I want to be open all the way.

This week I received part of a book and magazine lot from a past auction, my sister was kind enough to pick it up, and my parents brought it home today. There were a handful of Island and Canadian titles to add to my collection, with only two duplicates. One of those was actually welcome, since my original copy was falling apart. The magazines were all *The Island Magazine*, and even after setting aside the duplicates, there were more issues than I realized. Well worth what I paid, which is a relief; I had worried I’d overpaid.

There are still two more boxes to come, which my sister will pick up later this week. Not sure when they’ll make their way here. I’m a bit less hopeful about what’s in them, but they were much cheaper, so it balances out. I also picked up two routers; nothing special, but modern enough for some projects I have in mind.

Bike riding has been going alright. I’ve been pushing myself a bit lately, though today I took a break. I’m still getting used to the seat, sore in places I forgot I had. I’ve also started listening to podcasts again while riding. First up is the [Practicology Podcast](https://www.practicologypodcast.com/). I’m still way behind, but it’s full of informative and useful content.

Prayer and Bible study meeting is tomorrow evening. And if plans hold, I’ll be having supper with a few friends on Friday night. It’s been a fairly quiet week otherwise. The weather has been decent; too warm during the afternoons, but the evenings have been comfortably cool.

On the writing front, I’ve hit a bit of a block. I was hoping this blog would help knock some cobwebs loose and get things moving again. Still trying to finish the Christmas article; it’s all there, but I need to make it make sense on the page.

I’ve also been sorting through family photos. It’s a bit sad knowing there are still some people in those images I can’t identify, and with Grammie and Great-Grammie gone, I may never know who they were. I plan to reach out to extended family on all sides and ask to borrow photos to digitize. I’ll likely post on Facebook too, asking anyone in the local area if they have photos or documents related to Glenwood and nearby communities. I’d love to digitize them for preservation.

Anyways, that’s all for now.
