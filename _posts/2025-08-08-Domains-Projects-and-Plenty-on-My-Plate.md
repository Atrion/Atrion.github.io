Over the past few days, I’ve been getting familiar with Porkbun’s domain management. It’s fairly straightforward, but some settings are labelled differently than I’m used to. Still, I’m finding my way around.

I’ve spent some time working on *The Gospel from Gravel Hill* site, adding a few articles, uploading the 2025 conference audio, and getting the About Me page in place. Next, I need to dig through the backup of the *Glorious Gospel* site and pull out the non-audio content. Most of the audio has already been uploaded elsewhere, making it easier to link into the final version of the site.  

I also set up a landing page to tie my various online projects together. That said, subdomain forwarding and GitHub Pages have given me a bit of a headache. It’s been far too long since I last made a website, even something simple like these, so I’m rusty when it comes to troubleshooting certain issues.  

Conversations with my new friend have continued. I don’t think I’ve annoyed her too much yet, though I tend to feel like I might. She’s level-headed and boosts my confidence. Oh, to be as outgoing as she is. My introverted self shudders at the thought, but it’s something to strive for.  

On the Gospel front, I finally put out some related material. The push came when it was mentioned again that I might be doing one of the kids’ meetings soon. Fingers crossed — and prayers appreciated — that if and when it happens, it goes well. This month is shaping up to be full of speaking engagements: the last Saturday of the month I’m on the Zoom Gospel meeting for the Philippines, and on the 17th I’m speaking at the hall in the Gospel. That’s a lot of speaking for someone who doesn’t like to speak, but with God’s help, it’s worth it.  

Lately, my mind has been crowded with thoughts, not doubts about my faith, but questions about how good a Christian I am. Some would say that the fact it bothers me is a good sign. We are flawed people and will make mistakes. Mine may be mostly in thought right now, but they’re still real. Time spent with good friends might be the refresher I need to get moving in the right direction.  

A small practical project: I received a cord that should let me plug my phone directly into a router. I have a semi-old but usable one I picked up at auction. I plan to set it up for use at the hall to make connecting to the internet there easier than our current methods.  

On a different note, some leatherworking tools arrived today, along with one piece of leather (and another on the way). They’re low quality, but good enough for me to try my hand at rebinding a book I’ve been wanting to work on. Soon, I’ll need to officially add that to the project list.  

For now, I’m off to keep wrestling with the computer, trying to get it to work the way I want, and need, it to.
