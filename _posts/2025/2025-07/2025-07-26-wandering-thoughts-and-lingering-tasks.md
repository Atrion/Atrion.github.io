Time passes. My mind wanders. Things get left behind. I’ve said all this before, probably too many times, and I know I sound like a broken record by now. The truth is I forget, or worse, I don’t always care enough in the moment to sit down and write. But here I am again, doing what I should have done a while ago. Trying, at least, to catch the trail before it goes cold.

Life has been a mix of quiet routines and mental noise. The accounting work I’ve been doing is… going. I’m not sure if I’m moving fast enough, but I am getting faster. Things are getting done, and that’s something. Thursday was a full day in the office with someone walking me through several tasks I hadn’t learned yet. I took notes, relied on my memory, and think I’ve retained most of it. She’ll be back Tuesday and I’ve already got a list of new questions. Mostly about payroll, and the best way to input certain items. There’s still a lot I don’t know, But all things considered I think I am doing well...

It’d be helpful to get direct feedback, but from what I’ve heard passed along through mutual friends, it seems like I’m doing alright. At least, no complaints yet.

That same Thursday night was Bible study and prayer meeting. I was there, but not really there. Tired from the day, unprepared for the reading, and definitely not as spiritually present as I should’ve been. That’s on me. It frustrates me when I let things slip like that, especially when it comes to spiritual things. I need to be more intentional and bring it before God instead of just stewing in it.

On the brighter side of things, I’ve been talking more with someone I met online, a local friend who’s become a little closer recently. We chat back and forth most days, trade the occasional Snapchat pic (yes, I still use Snapchat, don’t judge), and just check in on each other’s lives. Making friends as an adult isn’t easy. Making friends as an adult with social limitations and a complete lack of understanding for half the cues people throw? Even harder. In General I often wonder if I’m being tolerated more than enjoyed. But that’s a hole I’m not ready to fall into tonight.

Back on the work front, there’s been no official talk yet about what comes next after the books are caught up. It’s definitely not full-time work, just a few days here and there, but part of me wouldn’t mind it continuing. Still, I’m trying not to get ahead of myself. Better to focus on finishing what’s in front of me than speculate too far ahead.

As for the things I usually love: history projects, community projects, writing, poetry; they’ve all been on pause. That’s how I tend to work, in bursts. Spurts of energy followed by stretches of silence. The last piece I wrote was an article and poem I submitted to *RED: The Island Magazine* for their 2025 Christmas issue. No word yet on whether it’s been accepted.

Right now, I’m laying in bed, typing this out on my phone in the dark. I should be sleeping, but my mind wouldn’t quiet down. Maybe this will help. I’d like to say “stay tuned” or promise more consistent updates, but I’m not about to lie. Things will come when they come.

Until next time -- whenever that is
