I’ve begun the journey through *Pilgrim’s Progress*, and the first chapter wastes no time in laying a foundation. It’s sobering, but also powerful.

### The City of Destruction  

Christian, a man deeply troubled by what he reads in his book, realizes that his home, the City of Destruction, is doomed to judgment. The burden of sin weighs heavy on his back, and he cannot find peace. He cries out for deliverance and, though mocked by neighbours and even pleaded with by his family, sets out to escape the coming wrath.  

**Matthew 3:7 (KJV)**  
> But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?  

The Christian journey begins with recognizing sin and fleeing judgment.
