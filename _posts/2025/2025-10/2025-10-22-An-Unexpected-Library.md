Sometimes blessings show up quietly, without any build-up or fanfare, and then land with enough weight to stop you in your tracks. This week, that blessing came in the form of **a trunk full of old books**... far more than I ever expected.

<!--more-->

A friend I met through the Gospel Halls knew that I love books, and since being saved, I’ve tried to study as much as I possibly can.  

He told me one day that *another* friend of his was clearing out a collection of older Christian books, volumes that had belonged to a family member who had passed away. He asked whether I’d want them.  
My answer was simple: *absolutely*. I didn’t even know what titles were involved yet, but if someone was willing to part with resources for study, teaching, and encouragement, then I was happy to take whatever they were offering.

And that was mostly the end of it, at least for a little while. A month or two went by with no news, and I didn’t think much more about it. These things take time.

Then I got the message:  

> *“I’ve got the books. I’ll be heading up your way.”*

Great! Except, of course, it had to be on the one night I wasn’t anywhere nearby. Thankfully a friend was able to meet him and pick them up for me.

Before he arrived, though, he sent one more message:

> *“Make sure they empty their trunk.”*

What? How many books were coming?

Well… a lot.  
*A lot.*

When I finally got to see them, I just stood there for a moment trying to take it all in. Entire **complete commentary series**, Bible reference collections, older but solid volumes full of depth and insight. These weren’t just random thrift-store leftovers. This was a preacher’s working library… and it now sat stacked across my hallway and my office floor because I don’t currently have the shelf space to house them properly.

### Where They Came From

I asked about the original owner and received this:

> “The books belonged to a preacher, **Bill Bingham**, who moved from Northern Ireland and settled in Nova Scotia. His son, **Ian Bingham**, still lives there with his wife, Brenda, and daughter, Lori-Ann. Ian has three other children: Brian (and Melanie) in Truro; Scott (and Leanne) in Pugwash; and Cheryl (and Craig Giddings) on PEI.”

I’m terrible with names, and I don’t believe I personally know any of the family, but I’m deeply appreciative of their willingness to pass these on rather than let them be discarded or left forgotten in storage. There’s something humbling about receiving the study tools of someone who served the Lord long before you ever did.

### Now the Hard Part…  
Finding a place to put them. Right now, they’re lined up along my hallway like a small Christian bookstore, and the foot traffic has become a bit of an obstacle course. I’ve already stubbed my toes more than once, which seems fair considering the sheer amount of material I now need to find a home for.

Bookshelves will have to be purchased, assembled, and somehow fitted into an already full space. But honestly? That’s a good problem to have.

I’m grateful. Truly grateful.

### A Final Thought

These books didn’t come to me by accident. The Lord has a way of putting the right tools in your hands at the right time, even if you don’t fully understand the timing. I don’t take that lightly.

And maybe, just maybe, someday someone will inherit *my* books too, and continue studying long after I’m gone.

Until then, I’ll do my best to make good use of what’s been entrusted to me.

**Psalm 119:111 (KJV)**  
> *Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.*

A fitting reminder that the greatest inheritance we receive, and pass on, is the Word of God itself.
