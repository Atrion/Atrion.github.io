This was originally going to be a few brief thoughts for a Sunday morning meeting, but I didn’t want to lose them to a notebook margin or a half-remembered outline.

I was enjoying Luke 7 this morning. It’s a chapter that feels both strong and tender at the same time, one of those places in Scripture where the Lord Jesus is presented with a clarity that quietly steadies the heart.

In Luke 7 we get at least three simple looks into our Lord: **His authority, His compassion, and His forgiving grace.**

<BR>

## Authority that strengthens faith  

> **Luke 7:6–9 (KJV)** <br>
> [6] Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof: <br>
> [7] Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed. <br>
> [8] For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. <br>
> [9] When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. <br>

The centurion stands out for two reasons that belong together.

First, his humility: *“I am not worthy.”*  
Second, his confidence in Christ: *“say in a word.”*

He doesn’t trust his own deserving. He trusts the authority of the Lord Jesus. That is such a good reminder to carry into any gathering of worship. We don’t approach God because we are worthy in ourselves, but because Christ is worthy, and because His word is enough.

## Compassion that meets grief  

> **Luke 7:13–15 (KJV)** <br>
> [13] And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not. <br>
> [14] And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. <br>
> [15] And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother. <br>

This is one of those scenes that has always stayed with me.

*“And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her…”*  So precious, so simple.

The One we come to remember is not only mighty. He is tender. His compassion isn’t a side-note to His character, it is part of the beauty of who He is. He sees sorrow, and He is not indifferent to it.

## Grace that forgives fully  

> **Luke 7:47–50 (KJV)** <br>
> [47] Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. <br>
> [48] And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven. <br>
> [49] And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also? <br>
> [50] And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace. <br>

The woman’s love is described as the evidence of grace received. The question is asked: *“Who is this that forgiveth sins also?”*  

Thankfully, we know who He is.

Luke shows us a love that flows *because* forgiveness has already been given. This is grace that doesn’t merely clean a record, it draws out worship.

<BR>

## A simple summary  
So in a very plain way, Luke 7 sets these truths in front of us:

- **Authority that strengthens faith,**  
- **Compassion that meets grief,**  
- **Grace that forgives fully and draws out worship.**

We were unworthy, and we still would be, left to ourselves. But we have been made accepted through our Lord Jesus Christ.

Just a few quiet thoughts from a morning reading. But they felt worth keeping close.
