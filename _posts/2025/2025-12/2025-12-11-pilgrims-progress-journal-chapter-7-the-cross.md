All of Christian’s journey so far, with its burden, fears, and struggles, has been leading him to one central place: **the Cross**.

### The Cross  

Christian comes to a hill, and there he sees the cross with a sepulchre just below. As he looks, the heavy burden on his back loosens, falls away, and tumbles into the empty tomb, never to be seen again. Overwhelmed, Christian weeps with joy. Three shining ones appear and minister to him: one assures him his sins are forgiven, one clothes him with new garments, and one sets a mark upon his forehead and places a sealed scroll in his hand for his journey to the Celestial City. At Calvary, Christian is not merely relieved, he is **changed**.  

**John 1:29 (KJV)**  
> [29] The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.  

At the cross, the burden of sin is removed forever.
