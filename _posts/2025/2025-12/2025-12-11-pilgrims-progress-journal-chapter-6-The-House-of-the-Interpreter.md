Having passed through the gate, Christian is now brought to a place where his eyes and heart will be further trained for the road ahead, **the House of the Interpreter**.

### The House of the Interpreter  

Inside, Christian is shown a series of living object lessons: a **dusty room** that cannot be cleansed by sweeping, but only by water; a **fire** that continues to burn even while water is poured over it; a **grave man** with a serious countenance and eyes lifted toward heaven; and several others. Each scene carries a spiritual meaning; about the power of the gospel to cleanse, the preservation of grace in the soul, and the character of true, heavenly-minded servants of God. These pictures are not mere curiosities, they are meant to shape Christian’s understanding and strengthen his resolve as he continues his pilgrimage.  

**John 14:26 (KJV)**  
> [26] But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.  

God provides spiritual understanding through the teaching of the Spirit.
