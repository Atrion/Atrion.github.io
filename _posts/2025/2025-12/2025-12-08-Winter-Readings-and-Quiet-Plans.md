Winter is officially here.

I wouldn’t say we’ve had a storm yet, but we’ve already had enough whiteout conditions and blowing snow for me. The schools have been cancelled a few days, and we even had to cancel our Prayer/Bible study meeting this past Thursday because the weather made it a bad idea for anyone to be on the roads.

That’s always a strange feeling, skipping a meeting not because of schedule or sickness, but because the Island has decided to remind us who’s really in charge of travel.

I’ve never been a fan of winter.

I can handle the cold well enough. The wind might not be my friend, but I’ve survived enough winters to know how to dress for it. The real issue is the snow itself. I hate shovelling snow. A little snow, a lot of snow, doesn’t matter. It’s all equally horrible.

If I could outsource that part of life permanently, I probably would.

But winter is winter, and PEI is PEI.

## The Quiet After

Since the end of Scott’s two-week series on the Tabernacle, things have been quieter in the most normal, healthy sense of the word.

We’re back into the rhythm of regular meetings at the hall. And in my own little corner of life, I’ve also been part of a couple WhatsApp Bible reading groups.

One of the readings is simple enough and honestly very enjoyable: **Luke one chapter at a time, up to Christmas.** It’s a good pace, a good season for it, and it feels fitting to walk through Luke’s careful, orderly account of Christ’s coming while the calendar moves closer to December 25th.

The other plan is the opposite of gentle: **The Bible in 90 days.** That one is… intense. I’d be lying if I said I was completely on top of every day’s reading. I’m not. But I’m trying to keep pace as best I can, and even when I slip a bit, I still find the effort worthwhile.

The group chats themselves have been a big part of the blessing. There are some very thoughtful, insightful believers in those threads, and sometimes the comments alone are enough to re-centre my focus. Even on days when I’m slightly behind, the shared observations have a way of pulling me back into the text and reminding me why I joined in the first place.

## Glenwood History: More Appears

On the history front, I’m nearing the end of digitising the old Glenwood documents I have.

That project has been quietly satisfying, slow, steady, and surprisingly personal at times. There’s something about handling old names, old stories, and half-forgotten accounts of local life that makes you realise how much can disappear if no one bothers to preserve it.

As if on cue, another person in the neighbourhood reached out and said he has **more documents and videos** for me to look at. So it looks like the “almost done” stage might just be the doorway to the next batch.

I plan to meet up with him soon and see what he has.

## A House-Sitting Stretch Coming Up

On the 21st of this month I’ll be heading to **Springfield West** to house and pet sit for about ten days.

A fellow who used to work with my father, and his wife, are heading out west to spend Christmas with their kids. So I’ll be keeping an eye on the place while they’re away. I don’t mind these stretches, honestly. They break up the routine just enough to feel like a small shift in scenery. And there’s something a little peaceful about being in a different house with a different daily rhythm for a week and a half.

## Pope Road and 1 Samuel

This week the **Pope Road assembly** is starting a week of Bible study in **1 Samuel**.

I’m hoping I can make it out in person for at least a meeting or two, but if the snow decides to throw its weight around again, I’ll catch the rest on Zoom. Either way, I’m glad they’re doing it. 1 Samuel is one of those books that rewards time and attention; leadership, failure, faith, patience, and God’s quiet sovereignty working through messy human decisions.

That kind of study always feels worth showing up for, even if it’s from a chair at home.

## The Usual Quiet Life

So that’s the update. It’s the usual boring, mundane life I tend to live, but I suppose that isn’t really something to complain about.

I’m thankful there isn’t anything dramatic I need to report.  
But I also wouldn’t mind a little more healthy activity sprinkled into the weeks ahead.

For now, though, this is enough.  
A quiet season, steady commitments, and the slow work of keeping up with what matters.
