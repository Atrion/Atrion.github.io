After all the distractions, detours, and discouragements, Christian finally comes to the place he has been longing for since leaving the City of Destruction, the **Wicket Gate**.

### The Narrow Gate  

At the gate, a man named **Goodwill** appears and, seeing Christian still burdened and afraid, gently pulls him in. It’s a simple but beautiful picture of how willing the Lord is to receive a repentant sinner. Goodwill assures Christian that this is the only path that leads to life, and then directs him onward to the **Interpreter’s House**, where he will gain further understanding for the journey ahead.  

**John 10:9 (KJV)**  
> [9] I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.  

Salvation is found only by entering through Christ.
