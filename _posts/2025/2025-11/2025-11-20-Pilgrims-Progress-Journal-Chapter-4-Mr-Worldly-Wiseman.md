As Christian continues his journey it doesn’t take long for another voice to offer “better” advice. A man called **Mr. Worldly Wiseman** appears with a more comfortable, respectable alternative to the hard road Christian has begun to walk.

### Mr. Worldly Wiseman  

Mr. Worldly Wiseman urges Christian to leave the narrow path and head instead to the town of **Morality**, where **Mr. Legality** supposedly knows how to relieve troubled consciences. If Christian will only become more upright and well–behaved, his burden will ease, or so he is told.  

Christian almost turns aside, but when the way grows dark and frightening, **Evangelist** finds him, rebukes his detour, and reminds him that **the law cannot save**. It can only show his guilt. Christian must look not to Legality, but to Christ alone.

**Galatians 2:16 (KJV)**  
> [16] Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.  

Man’s wisdom offers law; only Christ offers grace.
