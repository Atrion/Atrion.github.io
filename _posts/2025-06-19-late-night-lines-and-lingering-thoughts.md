It’s been a long evening, the kind where sleep stays just out of reach and your mind won’t quiet down. So instead of forcing it, I sat with the thoughts and let them come out the only way they know how to sometimes: as poetry.

Three different threads found their way to the page tonight. One rooted in grief, another in grace, and the last in the strange frustration and beauty of writing itself.

If you’re curious, you can read them here:

- 🪨 [Anchor Stone](https://atrion.github.io/writings/anchor-stone/) - A reflection of loss and remembrance.
- ✝️ [After the Change](https://atrion.github.io/writings/after-the-change/) - A quiet testimony of transformation.
- 🖋️ [Writer’s Lament](https://atrion.github.io/writings/writers-lament/) - A familiar struggle with expression.

It’s not always tidy or profound, but it’s honest. And that’s a start.
