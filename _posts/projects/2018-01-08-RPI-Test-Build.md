  This was a test run project for me. I found the tutorial linked below (All credit to this repo belongs to that article)
  
  This Gave me the change to see how travis cli works with github and what it can produce, as well as how to automate some of my setups on Raspberry pi systems.
  
  The next step is for me to customize the included scripts for my use, and then switch from Arch Linux do Debian, Raspbian or Ubuntu.
