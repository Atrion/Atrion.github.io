This past Sunday I spoke at the Willows: Just a short 10–15 minute Gospel message. It went… okay. I managed to get my main point across, though I didn’t feel like I delivered it as well as I could have. Others told me it came across fine, which I’m grateful for, but speaking has never been my strong suit. I rely heavily on my writing, and what works on paper doesn’t always flow the same way when spoken aloud. Still, by God’s grace the message was given, and that’s what matters most.  

> *“And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.”* -Luke 23:43 KJV  

Meanwhile, I’ve continued the process of tidying up my GitHub account. It’s something that had been long overdue. A pile of half-finished projects, old forks, and forgotten experiments were cluttering things up. Now, most of it is cleaned up, archived, or reorganized. The surprising thing is how this cleanup rekindled the itch to code again. I’ve started working on a handful of small repositories, nothing groundbreaking, just little side projects or ideas that amused me. Will any of them ever be “finished”? Probably not. But for me, it’s less about the end product and more about keeping my brain moving and practising what little coding knowledge I have.

Since the 13th, I’ve also been house-sitting for a friend while they’re away at a wedding. Part of that duty includes looking after their oldest son, who’s eleven. He’s a good kid. Most of his time is spent at school or sleeping, but the in-between moments are full of Lego, Wii games, and silly conversations. He misses his parents, of course, but aside from a few low spots he’s doing well. I probably let him get away with more than his parents would, but I’ve done my best not to let the reins slip too far. They’ll be home on Thursday, and I think we’ll both settle back into our normal routines just fine.  

Outside of those things, my week hasn’t been overly eventful. I’ve been following the news around Charlie Kirk. To be honest, I had never even heard of him before this recent incident. Out of curiosity, I started looking into who he was and what people were saying. Opinions about him seem split right down the middle, but whatever people think of his politics or personality, one thing seems clear: he didn’t deserve what happened to him. There are some lines that just shouldn’t be crossed, and I think most people, whatever side they’re on, should be able to agree on that.  

Digging into the story also pulled me back into some corners of the internet I hadn’t visited in years. These were sites I left behind long ago for good reason. They’ve always been rough places, but now they feel even darker, noisier, and harder to recognize. The bones of the old communities are still there, but the atmosphere is different. It’s a reminder of how fast things change online, and why it’s wise to be careful about how much time I spend in those spaces.  

> *“Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.”* -Philippians 4:8 KJV  

That verse is a needed reminder for me, that even though the noise of the world can be overwhelming, I need to focus on what is good and edifying. Not every online place or conversation fits that standard, and I need to guard my mind and heart accordingly.  

So, life right now is a mix of simple responsibilities, quiet projects, and the usual battles with my own thoughts. Some projects sit untouched, others get bursts of energy, and plenty hover somewhere in between. That’s just the way I seem to operate.
