Sometimes ideas need space to grow. That’s where I’ve found myself this week—thinking, building, and adapting.

I’ve quietly launched a separate [GitHub Pages site](https://thegloriousgospel.github.io) for **The Glorious Gospel** project. At the moment, it’s just a simple shell: a default (and admittedly older) theme with some custom tweaks—components rearranged, header image swapped, and a new favicon added.

I’m still waiting to hear back from the Oversight regarding adding it as a section of the [O’Leary Gospel Hall site](https://olearygospelhall.ca). But rather than press too hard or stall the idea, I decided to take the initiative. While I still believe that hosting it under the hall’s domain would offer more cohesion and credibility, this solo route gets the ball rolling. If things change, I can always shift gears.

One limitation with GitHub Pages is the file storage, anything above 1GB starts to raise eyebrows, and the repo max is around 5GB. With the full archive of Gospel audio clocking in around 80GB, obviously I won’t be hosting everything there. I’ll have to explore better audio hosting or embed options down the road. This first build is really just to establish the bones and start moving my mind in the right direction. A better theme and structure will likely follow in time.

In other news, last Friday marked the start of our **children’s meetings**, running each Friday throughout the summer. I’ve been asked to take a message for one of them, possibly next week. I’m debating speaking on *The Lost Sheep*. As a kid, I was always misplacing things, so I’m hoping the idea of something precious being lost (and found) will resonate. Honestly, I usually get along better with kids than adults, so maybe I’ll do alright!

On the tech front, I picked up a **mini PC** from GMKtec. It’s marketed as a “mini gaming PC,” though it’s definitely toward the budget end of that spectrum. Still, it seems to handle what I need just fine, running with my portable screen and mechanical keyboard setup. Setup had its usual Microsoft quirks, but at least it’s not full of bloatware or spyware.

I also had a bit of a rescue project handed to me Sunday: an old, non-functioning laptop from one of our elders. He’d long given it up for dead but hoped I might be able to retrieve some photos. After pulling the drive, hooking it up to my machine via USB, and adjusting some permissions, I managed to recover about 90% of the contents. The rest was lost to corruption from the failing drive, unfortunately. I’ll be handing the salvaged files back to him on a USB drive this Thursday at Bible study. I really hope it brings some joy and relief.

The laptop itself was destined for the scrap heap, so I gave it a second life. Slapped in an old 80GB drive from my stash and installed Debian Linux on it. It’s running decently and might become a small personal Linux sandbox, or maybe even a MagicMirror project down the road. We’ll see.

Anyway, there’s probably more I could mention, but my brain is fogging up in the heat. It's currently sitting at **31°C in my room** as I type this, which isn’t exactly ideal for productivity or coherence.

Till next time.
