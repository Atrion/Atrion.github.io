I know many have already read *The Pilgrim’s Progress*. My own copy came from Timmy, though to be honest I never got past the first chapter until now.  

While biking I’ve been catching up on the *Practicology Podcast*, and a few years back they did several episodes working through the book. That was the final push I needed to finally sit down and read it properly.

I bring this up because I’d like to extend the invitation: if you haven’t read *Pilgrim’s Progress* before, or maybe if you’d like to revisit it again, why not join me as I read through it?  

If you don’t have a physical copy, there’s a digital version available here (including both Part 1 and Part 2), along with MP3 audio recordings of both parts:

This will be the main post for introducing the project. As I finish each chapter, I’ll share a short blog entry with a summary, reflections, and a related Bible verse. If you’re following along, feel free to read and reflect with me.
