As the story continues, we’re introduced to two neighbours who chase after Christian, men who reveal very different hearts when confronted with the call to leave the City of Destruction.

### Obstinate and Pliable  

Two neighbours, Obstinate and Pliable, pursue Christian. Obstinate refuses to leave his comforts and mocks the journey. Pliable, easily persuaded, joins Christian with enthusiasm, curious about the rewards promised at the journey’s end. Yet his eagerness has no depth, revealing that true faith must be rooted in conviction, not passing interest.  

**Matthew 13:20-21 (KJV)**  
> [20] But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;  
> [21] Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.  

Shallow faith cannot withstand hardship.
