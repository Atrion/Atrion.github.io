This Page is A Collection of Scans from a box of Documents, now owned by Tammy Gorrill-Gallant.
This Box of documents is all that remains of the Glenwood Historic Group, which was created in 1981 by Kieth Gorrill and Steward Gillcash.

I was given the opertunity to view and digitize these documents, for future use on my Glenwood projects. 
Displayed here are some of the raw scans of these douments.
