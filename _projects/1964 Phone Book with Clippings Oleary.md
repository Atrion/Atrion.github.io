This is a Set of digital photos of a damaged Phone Book dating back to around 1964. 
The book had been turned into a scrapbook of newspaper clippings and shows signs of significant wear. 

This Phonebook belonged to Lilla MacNiell (Kevin MacNeill's Grandmother) of Milburn, PEI.

This item was graciously loaned to me by Glenwood resident Kevin MacNeill.

This Page contains just photos of the Full Pages of the O'Leary Section of the Book.
