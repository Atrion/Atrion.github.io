      <p>Living each day, striving to walk His way,
Seeking His presence as we sit and pray,
Following closely, obeying His call,
Soon He will come for all.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Patiently waiting for that glorious day,
Praising Him always, in His perfect way,
Living each moment, guided by His light,
In glory oh so bright.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Walking in faith, trusting His perfect way,
Serving in love, we worship and we pray,
Living in hope, we hold His promise near,
Our Saviour will appear.</p>

<p>Bearing our cross, we follow in His steps,
Shining His love, we share the joy He kept,
Faithful and true, through trials we stand,
For that heavenly land.</p>

<p>Jesus, our King, we honor and adore,
He is our life, our hope forevermore,
With every breath, we offer Him our praise,
This till the end of days.</p>
