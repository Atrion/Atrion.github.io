  <p>Just a short note for now, nothing major to update, but still a few small things in progress behind the scenes.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on formatting some <strong>new design options</strong> for this site. Mostly layout tweaks and trying out different ways to display things better, especially the poetry section. Speaking of which, I plan to <strong>upload a few more poems</strong> this week, some older, some recent. I’m trying to get better at sharing them, rather than letting them sit forgotten in folders.</p>

<p>Also starting to wonder: <strong>has anyone actually been reading any of this?</strong> Not that I mind if not, this space still helps me get my thoughts in order. But part of me wonders if a <strong>commenting feature</strong> might be something to look into. Maybe there’s a simple way to implement one without making things messy or difficult to maintain. We’ll see.</p>

<p>Anyway, just keeping things moving quietly. Updates will be small and steady. As always, thanks if you’re reading, even silently.</p>
