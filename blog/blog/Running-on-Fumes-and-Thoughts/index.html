  <p>Running into Sunday with absolutely zero sleep is a special kind of disorientation. I’m not sure how I managed to function, but I did. And somehow, the Lord’s Day worship and breaking of bread was good, peaceful, weighty, needed.</p>

<p>I had something on my heart to share during the meeting, but once again, I kept quiet. I don’t know why I freeze up when it matters. It’s frustrating, because it felt like something I was meant to say. And I didn’t.</p>

<p>There was a baptism at the hall after. That always puts things in perspective. New beginnings, public faith, the beauty of submission. After everyone left, I stayed behind and spent most of the afternoon alone at the hall. Tried to nap a bit, didn’t happen. Ended up making a coffee and settling in reading my Bible for a while.</p>

<p>Later, while editing the audio from the day’s messages, I managed to put the wrong last name on one of the speakers. As soon as people noticed, I felt embarrassed and honestly, kind of foolish.</p>

<p>This week’s writing goal is to wrap up an article I’ve been drafting in hopes of submitting it somewhere. I also unearthed some very old poetry; cringy stuff from years back; that I’m thinking of retyping and archiving. Maybe I’ll even post a few, if I can get over the secondhand embarrassment. There’s also a Christian-centered article I keep setting aside. Feels like it deserves more attention than I’ve been giving it, even if I don’t know who’s actually reading any of this besides me.</p>

<p>Might look into some local outlets for submitting writing, too. I don’t expect much, but I want to start trying more. If nothing else, it helps me keep moving.</p>

<p>The diet’s still on track, even if the weight loss has slowed a bit. Still, slow progress is better than none, and definitely better than the alternative.</p>

<p>That ministry message from Sunday morning has stuck with me. Still chewing on it. No flashy takeaway yet, just the quiet nudge that there’s something there I need to sit with.</p>

<p>Anyway, that’s where I’m at. Tired. Reflective. Trying.</p>
