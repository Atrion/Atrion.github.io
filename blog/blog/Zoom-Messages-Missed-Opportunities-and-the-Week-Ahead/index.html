  <p>Saturday morning I had the opportunity to share the Gospel during a Zoom meeting for the Philippines. The whole session ran about 30 minutes, with my portion taking around 15. I tried something new this time: instead of just a single camera feed, I used a dual-window setup. My video was in the lower-left corner, and the main screen displayed Bible verses in both English and Tagalog. I used <strong>FreeShow</strong> for the Scripture display and <strong>OBS</strong> to tie everything together.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> it went well, but I’m never the best judge of my own speaking. I tend to second guess how it landed. Sometimes I wonder if people say the message was good just to keep from discouraging me.</p>

<p>Now I’m working on a ministry message for later this month, our usual <strong>second Thursday</strong> ministry night. I’ve also started laying the groundwork for a written devotional series based on the <strong>churches in Revelation</strong>. That project is still in the research phase, but it’s taking shape. In addition, I’m preparing a spoken devotional for <strong>Orangewood Gospel Hall’s Saturday Zoom broadcast</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Take all our troubles to God in prayer.</em><br />
But I often wonder what His response is, or if I even hear it right.<br />
I still struggle with myself; with anxiety, hesitation, and self-doubt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are moments when I want to stand up during a meeting and pray, or share verses or ministry, but I hold back. I fight myself - mentally and emotionally - and more often than not, I end up sitting in silence.</p>

<p>That said, I <em>did</em> follow through on the Zoom Gospel this past Saturday. And I’m scheduled for a short Gospel message at <strong>The Willows</strong> the Sunday after next.</p>

<p>I’ve learned that once I commit to speaking, I follow through, even if I don’t always feel like the message is great. But trying to apply that same mindset in regular meetings doesn’t always work.</p>

<p>Some days I wonder if my faith is lacking, not because I don’t believe, but because <strong>I get in the way of myself</strong>.</p>

<p>If you’ve read this far, you’ve probably gathered that my brain is a strange place to be. Hah!</p>

<hr />

<p>Another Sunday has come and gone without me rising to speak. The meeting was fairly full, with a visiting guest in as well, so things moved quickly from one speaker to the next. That’s my <em>excuse</em>, anyway. Deep down I know it’s just that, an excuse. And it frustrates me. Then I get frustrated about being frustrated. A cycle.</p>

<hr />

<p>We had a <strong>free yard sale</strong> at the hall on Saturday. I wasn’t able to attend, but I did contribute a few books and designed the flyer and online ad. Unfortunately, it also led to an issue Sunday morning, I was running late and didn’t realize the <strong>main microphone had been unplugged</strong> for the yard sale. I didn’t notice it wasn’t reconnected. So the <strong>Sunday morning audio recording</strong> ended up being captured only by the backup mic at the back of the room. That mic is old, meant mostly for enhancing hymn vocals. The result: muddy, distant audio. I managed to salvage part of the message, but not all. Disappointing, but a lesson learned.</p>

<hr />

<p>This upcoming weekend I’ll be traveling to the <strong>Halifax Bible Study Conference</strong>. I’ll be going with a few people I haven’t traveled with before, so that’ll be a new experience. I’m still not sure if we leave Friday or Saturday, but I’ll have the full details soon. It may be socially exhausting, but I truly think (and pray) it will be worth it. Even just for the time in the Word and the ministry itself.</p>

<p>More updates to come - Lord willing.</p>
