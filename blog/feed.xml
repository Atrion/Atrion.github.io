  <li>Finding a way to organize my older writings and poems.</li>
  <li>Building some templates to aid my personal Bible study.</li>
  <li>??? Things</li>

<p>Some of these will happen. Some might get abandoned.

<p>Honestly, I don’t really know what this blog will become. I’ve started blogs before, more times than I can probably count, and somewhere along the way I either got bored, forgot about them, or just moved on. Can’t exactly say that won’t happen again, but I’m trying to do better this time around.</p>

<p>I don’t have a clear direction yet. Maybe I’ll talk about projects I’m working on, maybe share some poems or writings, maybe just rant a little when the day calls for it.</p>

<p>A little about me for anyone who stumbles across this:
I’m from Prince Edward Island, Canada, born and raised here. I have a strong Christian faith. My life changed completely back in November of 2022 when my Spouse of 16 years passed away, and then it changed again in March of 2023 when I trusted Christ for salvation. Since then, everything’s been different, not perfect, not always easy, but different in a way that matters.</p>

<p>Outside of that, I have way too many half-finished projects, a love for technology, an interest in writing, and probably too much to say when I actually sit down and start typing.</p>

<p>So here it is: the first post.</p>

<p>Let’s see where it goes.</p>]]></content><author><name>Atrion Darnay</name></author><category term="journal" /><category term="Personal" /><category term="introduction" /><category term="beginning" /><category term="personal" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So here we are]]></summary></entry></feed>
