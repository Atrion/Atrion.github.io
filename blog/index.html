      <p>Saturday morning I had the opportunity to share the Gospel during a Zoom meeting for the Philippines. The whole session ran about 30 minutes, with my portion taking around 15. I tried something new this time: instead of just a single camera feed, I used a dual-window setup. My video was in the lower-left corner, and the main screen displayed Bible verses in both English and Tagalog. I used <strong>FreeShow</strong> for the Scripture display and <strong>OBS</strong> to tie everything together.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> it went well, but I’m never the best judge of my own speaking. I tend to second guess how it landed. Sometimes I wonder if people say the message was good just to keep from discouraging me.</p>

      <p>Lately I’ve been working on my Gospel message for the upcoming Zoom meeting with the Philippines, scheduled for May 31st. It’s been on my mind more than usual. I tend to second-guess my messages, not because I don’t believe them, but because I often lack a bit of confidence in my delivery.</p>

<p>My friend Timmy, who passed away earlier this year, used to review all of my messages before I shared them. He was a trusted sounding board, and I leaned on his input more than I realized. Knowing someone else had read through what I had prepared always gave me some peace of mind, that I was on the right track. I miss that encouragement.</p>

      <p>So, it’s been a bit since the last post.</p>

<p>The Island Gospel Conference just wrapped up this past weekend. It was held at Bluefield School, and as always, it was a blessing. Solid ministry, a clear and faithful gospel message, more good food than any of us needed, sugary desserts that tested everyone’s resolve, and most of all, amazing fellowship with other believers.</p>

<p>I had some deep, meaningful conversations with a few preachers whose words and lives have been a great inspiration to me. Moments like that stick with you.</p>

      <p>Just a short note for now, nothing major to update, but still a few small things in progress behind the scenes.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on formatting some <strong>new design options</strong> for this site. Mostly layout tweaks and trying out different ways to display things better, especially the poetry section. Speaking of which, I plan to <strong>upload a few more poems</strong> this week, some older, some recent. I’m trying to get better at sharing them, rather than letting them sit forgotten in folders.</p>

      <p>Not a whole lot to report today, but I’ll put a few things down while I’ve got the time and clarity.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday night’s meeting</strong> was encouraging, though I didn’t get up to speak this time. The prayer portion ran longer than usual, which is a good problem to have. After that, another Brother stood up and shared a message that really uplifted the assembly. So while I stayed quiet, I don’t see that as a loss, the message that was needed got spoken, and I was glad to hear it.</p>

<p><strong>Friday</strong> was the usual grocery day: expensive, dull, and necessary. Not much else to say there.</p>
