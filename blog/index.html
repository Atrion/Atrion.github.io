<h2 id="website-rant">Website Rant</h2>

<p>Let’s be honest, some days the world feels a little broken.</p>

<p>Not in the big dramatic "end of everything" way, but in the small stupid things: slow websites, confusing paperwork, people who block store aisles…</p>

<p>Today’s minor frustration was just trying to get this blog fully set up. Tiny tweaks turning into small problems. But you know what? I got there.</p>

<p>Sometimes you just have to rant a little, then get back to it.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="projects-im-thinking-about">Projects I’m Thinking About</h2>

<p>Here’s a few things on my mind lately:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Expanding this blog little by little.</li>
  <li>Finding a way to organize my older writings and poems.</li>
  <li>Building some templates to aid my personal Bible study.</li>
  <li>??? Things</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these will happen. Some might get abandoned. But that’s life, right?</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="why-i-write-even-when-im-not-sure">Why I Write (Even When I’m Not Sure)</h2>

<p>Writing has always been a strange thing for me.</p>

<p>Sometimes I write because I feel like I have something to say. Sometimes I write just because the page is there, and it’s empty, and it feels wrong to leave it blank.</p>

<p>I don’t know where this site will go. I don’t even know what exactly it will become. But I’m starting it because I want to try. To share. To build. To maybe say something that matters, even if it’s just to myself.</p>

<p>We’ll see where it leads.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="starting-somewhere">Starting Somewhere</h2>

<p>So here we are.</p>

<p>Honestly, I don’t really know what this blog will become. I’ve started blogs before, more times than I can probably count, and somewhere along the way I either got bored, forgot about them, or just moved on. Can’t exactly say that won’t happen again, but I’m trying to do better this time around.</p>

<p>I don’t have a clear direction yet. Maybe I’ll talk about projects I’m working on, maybe share some poems or writings, maybe just rant a little when the day calls for it.</p>

<p>A little about me for anyone who stumbles across this:
I’m from Prince Edward Island, Canada, born and raised here. I have a strong Christian faith. My life changed completely back in November of 2022 when my Spouse of 16 years passed away, and then it changed again in March of 2023 when I trusted Christ for salvation. Since then, everything’s been different, not perfect, not always easy, but different in a way that matters.</p>

<p>Outside of that, I have way too many half-finished projects, a love for technology, an interest in writing, and probably too much to say when I actually sit down and start typing.</p>

<p>So here it is: the first post.</p>

<p>Let’s see where it goes.</p>
