    <p>Lately I’ve been working on my Gospel message for the upcoming Zoom meeting with the Philippines, scheduled for May 31st. It’s been on my mind more than usual. I tend to second-guess my messages, not because I don’t believe them, but because I often lack a bit of confidence in my delivery.</p>

<p>My friend Timmy, who passed away earlier this year, used to review all of my messages before I shared them. He was a trusted sounding board, and I leaned on his input more than I realized. Knowing someone else had read through what I had prepared always gave me some peace of mind, that I was on the right track. I miss that encouragement.</p>

<p>I’m also not the most comfortable speaker. Unlike many who go up with a few bullet points or rely on a flow of spontaneous thought, I write everything out, word for word. That’s how I make sense of the message. The clarity doesn’t usually come when I stand up to speak; it comes when pen hits paper (or more often, fingers hit the keyboard). I do sometimes veer from the script in the moment, but having every word written means that when my mind blanks, I’m not stuck.</p>

<p>Outside of message prep, I’ve been slowly cataloging my personal book collection, starting with the PEI books. It’s a larger task than I expected. Only about half of them scanned properly, and of those, I’ve had to manually add cover images for nearly half again. And of course, the other half didn’t scan at all. So now I’m plugging them in manually one by one. It’s slow work, but it’s necessary. I’ve already bought duplicates more than once simply because I forgot what I had.</p>

<p>Tonight is prayer and Bible study at the O’Leary Gospel Hall. We’re starting at 1 Peter 1:18, likely wrapping up the rest of the chapter. I’d like to say I’m ready, but more often than not, I feel like I’m more prepared than I actually am. Still, being among the believers, digging into the Word, it always turns out to be worthwhile, whether I speak up or not.</p>

<p>We press on.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/blog/Post-Conference-Reflections-and-Birthday-Moments/">Post-Conference Reflections and Birthday Moments</a></h2>
  <p class="post-date">May 20, 2025 at 02:00 AM</p>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p>So, it’s been a bit since the last post.</p>

<p>The Island Gospel Conference just wrapped up this past weekend. It was held at Bluefield School, and as always, it was a blessing. Solid ministry, a clear and faithful gospel message, more good food than any of us needed, sugary desserts that tested everyone’s resolve, and most of all, amazing fellowship with other believers.</p>

<p>I had some deep, meaningful conversations with a few preachers whose words and lives have been a great inspiration to me. Moments like that stick with you.</p>

<p>There was a particularly encouraging moment when someone who hadn’t seen me since before I started my diet pointed out how much weight I’d lost. I’m not sure I always see it myself, but it meant a lot to hear it from someone who remembered what I looked like before. Here’s hoping the next six months bring the same kind of progress.</p>

<p>Today was the birthday of a friend, and the wife of another friend, part of the MacKenzie family, who truly treat me like one of their own. They’re always kind, warm, and welcoming, and I’ve never left their home without a smile. We shared a big meal, had cake for her, and surprisingly another cake for me, since my birthday is tomorrow. I got to spend time with the whole family, chatted with the adults, and read a few books to the kids. Honestly, it was one of those evenings that reminds you what real community looks like.</p>

<p>The challenge now is to carry the weight of the ministry shared at the conference into daily life. It’s easy to let the “conference high” fade once everything returns to normal. I’ve started relistening to some of the messages and taking notes. Truthfully, I really need to learn to take notes during the meetings themselves, but there’s something about hearing it again that helps it finally land.</p>

<p>A friend of mine has his girlfriend visiting, but her trip is nearing its end, she leaves mid-day Wednesday. I know it’s going to be tough for him once she’s gone. Sometimes the hardest part of something good is saying goodbye to it, even if it is only for a time.</p>

<p>And as for this blog, I can’t let it go the way of so many past attempts. I’m not aiming to post daily, but I need to commit to at least a weekly update. It helps keep the momentum going and keeps me grounded.</p>

<p>If everything worked like I hoped, there should be a few images from the conference just below. (Still figuring this part out.)</p>

<p>Until next time.</p>

    <p>Just a short note for now, nothing major to update, but still a few small things in progress behind the scenes.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on formatting some <strong>new design options</strong> for this site. Mostly layout tweaks and trying out different ways to display things better, especially the poetry section. Speaking of which, I plan to <strong>upload a few more poems</strong> this week, some older, some recent. I’m trying to get better at sharing them, rather than letting them sit forgotten in folders.</p>

<p>Also starting to wonder: <strong>has anyone actually been reading any of this?</strong> Not that I mind if not, this space still helps me get my thoughts in order. But part of me wonders if a <strong>commenting feature</strong> might be something to look into. Maybe there’s a simple way to implement one without making things messy or difficult to maintain. We’ll see.</p>

<p>Anyway, just keeping things moving quietly. Updates will be small and steady. As always, thanks if you’re reading, even silently.</p>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Not a whole lot to report today, but I’ll put a few things down while I’ve got the time and clarity.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday night’s meeting</strong> was encouraging, though I didn’t get up to speak this time. The prayer portion ran longer than usual, which is a good problem to have. After that, another Brother stood up and shared a message that really uplifted the assembly. So while I stayed quiet, I don’t see that as a loss, the message that was needed got spoken, and I was glad to hear it.</p>

<p><strong>Friday</strong> was the usual grocery day: expensive, dull, and necessary. Not much else to say there.</p>

<p>I’ve spent a good chunk of the week <strong>reformatting and organizing my notes in Obsidian</strong>, moving over transcripts, personal writings, poetry, and more. The structure is starting to make sense now.</p>

<p>Two writing projects hit milestones this week. I finished off a devotional series on <strong>“The Christian Armour”</strong> and completed <strong>Part One</strong> of an article titled <strong>“The Gift of Singleness.”</strong> So far, the devotional pieces have been shared within my assembly and with a trusted friend who’s also a preacher. I’ve also passed the article along to him and hope to get some honest feedback soon.</p>

<p>Today was a bit more lively. The siblings came over, and we had a combined family get-together ( part late Easter, part Mother’s Day, part Mom’s birthday, part my own birthday). Just a simple afternoon with pizza, cake, and the nephews. Nothing fancy, but good to have everyone under the same roof for a while.</p>

<p><strong>Tomorrow morning is our usual Gospel meeting for the Philippines via Zoom.</strong> My turn to speak is coming up at the end of the month (May 31st), so I’ll need to start praying and preparing for that as well.</p>

<p>My sister also brought up some books and magazines I picked up in a recent local auction. What I thought was just a single bound volume of 1920s newspapers has turned out to be one full book <em>plus</em> several bags of partial bindings. That’s going to take some sorting, and I’m not sure where I’m putting it all yet.</p>

<p>Which ties into another ongoing task: <strong>figuring out a way to properly catalogue my Island book collection.</strong> A lot of these books don’t have ISBNs, either due to age or obscurity, and many aren’t listed in any known databases. I might have to do this manually, which is a daunting prospect, but I want to make sure they’re preserved and documented.</p>

<p>Tonight there’s a <strong>devotional message on Zoom</strong>, hosted by <strong>Orangewood Gospel Hall in the USA</strong>. Then it’s off to bed and preparing my heart and mind for the <strong>Worship and Breaking of Bread meeting</strong> tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>That’s it for now. Just a mix of small updates and quiet work.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/blog/Six-Months-Down/">Six Months Down</a></h2>
  <p class="post-date">May 08, 2025 at 05:18 PM</p>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Today marks <strong>six months</strong> since I started changing my diet.</p>

<p>It hasn’t always been easy, but it’s been worth it. I’m down another <strong>3.9 lbs this week</strong>, bringing the total weight lost so far to <strong>77.6 lbs</strong>. It still surprises me seeing the number go down like that, but I’m learning not to question good progress. Just keep at it, day by day.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the productivity side, I’m finally getting the hang of <strong>Obsidian</strong>,  at least the basics. I’ve started moving my <strong>Bible study notes</strong> into the vault, trying to organize them in a way that makes sense long-term. Same goes for my scattered thoughts, plans, and project outlines.</p>

<p>For writing, I’m still using <strong>Google Docs</strong> when it comes to longer articles. It’s just easier for layout and editing, especially when I’m on the go. But I’m thinking of switching from <strong>Google Keep</strong> to the <strong>Android version of Obsidian</strong> for note-taking. We’ll see how that works in practice.</p>

<hr />

<p>Tonight is the Prayer Meeting and Ministry message at <strong>O’Leary Gospel Hall</strong>. I’ve had some thoughts rattling around, maybe even the bones of a message, but I haven’t managed to piece it all together. I’m not even sure if I’ll stand up and speak at all. The hesitation is frustrating, but I’m learning not to push myself too hard.</p>

<p>Just thought I’d check in and record it.</p>
