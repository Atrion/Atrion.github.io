    <p>Not a whole lot to report today, but I’ll put a few things down while I’ve got the time and clarity.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday night’s meeting</strong> was encouraging, though I didn’t get up to speak this time. The prayer portion ran longer than usual, which is a good problem to have. After that, another Brother stood up and shared a message that really uplifted the assembly. So while I stayed quiet, I don’t see that as a loss, the message that was needed got spoken, and I was glad to hear it.</p>

<p><strong>Friday</strong> was the usual grocery day: expensive, dull, and necessary. Not much else to say there.</p>

<p>I’ve spent a good chunk of the week <strong>reformatting and organizing my notes in Obsidian</strong>, moving over transcripts, personal writings, poetry, and more. The structure is starting to make sense now.</p>

<p>Two writing projects hit milestones this week. I finished off a devotional series on <strong>“The Christian Armour”</strong> and completed <strong>Part One</strong> of an article titled <strong>“The Gift of Singleness.”</strong> So far, the devotional pieces have been shared within my assembly and with a trusted friend who’s also a preacher. I’ve also passed the article along to him and hope to get some honest feedback soon.</p>

<p>Today was a bit more lively. The siblings came over, and we had a combined family get-together ( part late Easter, part Mother’s Day, part Mom’s birthday, part my own birthday). Just a simple afternoon with pizza, cake, and the nephews. Nothing fancy, but good to have everyone under the same roof for a while.</p>

<p><strong>Tomorrow morning is our usual Gospel meeting for the Philippines via Zoom.</strong> My turn to speak is coming up at the end of the month (May 31st), so I’ll need to start praying and preparing for that as well.</p>

<p>My sister also brought up some books and magazines I picked up in a recent local auction. What I thought was just a single bound volume of 1920s newspapers has turned out to be one full book <em>plus</em> several bags of partial bindings. That’s going to take some sorting, and I’m not sure where I’m putting it all yet.</p>

<p>Which ties into another ongoing task: <strong>figuring out a way to properly catalogue my Island book collection.</strong> A lot of these books don’t have ISBNs, either due to age or obscurity, and many aren’t listed in any known databases. I might have to do this manually, which is a daunting prospect, but I want to make sure they’re preserved and documented.</p>

<p>Tonight there’s a <strong>devotional message on Zoom</strong>, hosted by <strong>Orangewood Gospel Hall in the USA</strong>. Then it’s off to bed and preparing my heart and mind for the <strong>Worship and Breaking of Bread meeting</strong> tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>That’s it for now. Just a mix of small updates and quiet work.</p>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Today marks <strong>six months</strong> since I started changing my diet.</p>

<p>It hasn’t always been easy, but it’s been worth it. I’m down another <strong>3.9 lbs this week</strong>, bringing the total weight lost so far to <strong>77.6 lbs</strong>. It still surprises me seeing the number go down like that, but I’m learning not to question good progress. Just keep at it, day by day.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the productivity side, I’m finally getting the hang of <strong>Obsidian</strong>,  at least the basics. I’ve started moving my <strong>Bible study notes</strong> into the vault, trying to organize them in a way that makes sense long-term. Same goes for my scattered thoughts, plans, and project outlines.</p>

<p>For writing, I’m still using <strong>Google Docs</strong> when it comes to longer articles. It’s just easier for layout and editing, especially when I’m on the go. But I’m thinking of switching from <strong>Google Keep</strong> to the <strong>Android version of Obsidian</strong> for note-taking. We’ll see how that works in practice.</p>

<hr />

<p>Tonight is the Prayer Meeting and Ministry message at <strong>O’Leary Gospel Hall</strong>. I’ve had some thoughts rattling around, maybe even the bones of a message, but I haven’t managed to piece it all together. I’m not even sure if I’ll stand up and speak at all. The hesitation is frustrating, but I’m learning not to push myself too hard.</p>

<p>Just thought I’d check in and record it.</p>

    <p>Running into Sunday with absolutely zero sleep is a special kind of disorientation. I’m not sure how I managed to function, but I did. And somehow, the Lord’s Day worship and breaking of bread was good, peaceful, weighty, needed.</p>

<p>I had something on my heart to share during the meeting, but once again, I kept quiet. I don’t know why I freeze up when it matters. It’s frustrating, because it felt like something I was meant to say. And I didn’t.</p>

<p>There was a baptism at the hall after. That always puts things in perspective. New beginnings, public faith, the beauty of submission. After everyone left, I stayed behind and spent most of the afternoon alone at the hall. Tried to nap a bit, didn’t happen. Ended up making a coffee and settling in reading my Bible for a while.</p>

<p>Later, while editing the audio from the day’s messages, I managed to put the wrong last name on one of the speakers. As soon as people noticed, I felt embarrassed and honestly, kind of foolish.</p>

<p>This week’s writing goal is to wrap up an article I’ve been drafting in hopes of submitting it somewhere. I also unearthed some very old poetry; cringy stuff from years back; that I’m thinking of retyping and archiving. Maybe I’ll even post a few, if I can get over the secondhand embarrassment. There’s also a Christian-centered article I keep setting aside. Feels like it deserves more attention than I’ve been giving it, even if I don’t know who’s actually reading any of this besides me.</p>

<p>Might look into some local outlets for submitting writing, too. I don’t expect much, but I want to start trying more. If nothing else, it helps me keep moving.</p>

<p>The diet’s still on track, even if the weight loss has slowed a bit. Still, slow progress is better than none, and definitely better than the alternative.</p>

<p>That ministry message from Sunday morning has stuck with me. Still chewing on it. No flashy takeaway yet, just the quiet nudge that there’s something there I need to sit with.</p>

<p>Anyway, that’s where I’m at. Tired. Reflective. Trying.</p>

    <p>It’s one of those days where everything I own seems to be in a different pile. Notes tucked into old folders, ideas scribbled on scraps I barely remember writing, photos scanned but never sorted, there’s just a little bit of everything and a whole lot of nowhere to put it.</p>

<p>I’ve been chipping away at deciding what’s worth keeping, what needs to be worked on, and what’s finally ready for the trash. You’d think after all this time I’d be better at staying organized, but then again, maybe that’s part of the charm. Or at least, that’s what I tell myself.</p>

<p>Somehow in the middle of all this, I’ve found myself juggling two writing projects and a couple of research tangents that feel like they’ve spiraled into full dissertations. If only this scattered brain could pay the bills, right? Hah.</p>

<p>The Island Gospel Conference is coming up in a couple weeks, weekend of the 17th. I tried going to a ministry meeting with a friend last night. Turns out it wasn’t on. We only figured that out after we got there. Made the best of it though, met up with someone else instead, grabbed some food, and had some genuinely good conversations. Sometimes plans falling through lead to better ones.</p>

<p>I’ve also been thinking about journaling lately. It’s something I’ve never been great at. I’ll go through spurts and stops, but I’m always glad when I have a record to look back on later. Not because I think anything I’ve done is all that remarkable, but just because it’s good to remember. These posts are kind of like a public journal. I’ve kept private ones, too. Some are still around. Some probably got tossed in one of those cleaning frenzies. That’s okay.</p>

<p>Anyway, time to get back to sorting and writing. Maybe I’ll actually finish something tonight, but first, Bible reading and getting myself ready for tomorrow’s worship and breaking of bread. Everything else can wait a bit.</p>

<p>Until next time.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/blog/Getting-Back-Into-Things/">Getting Back Into Things</a></h2>
  <p class="post-date">April 30, 2025 at 02:30 AM</p>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Today felt like one of those quiet resets, not because anything grand happened, but because a few things finally moved forward.</p>

<p>For one, I got back on a bike again. It’s been years. My legs remembered how (mostly), but that seat has no mercy. Felt like I pedaled for five minutes and had earned an ice pack and a nap. But it’s a start. The plan isn’t distance or speed right now it’s <em>consistency</em>.</p>

<p>I also took some time to clean up this site, just a bunch of small updates here and there. Little style tweaks, layout fixes, improved tagging. I want this to be something I can build on slowly, not something that gets away from me like blogs in the past.</p>

<p>That goes for my Obsidian vault too. It got overgrown, bloated with folders and tags and items I wasn’t really using. Today was the start of a trim-back. Reorganizing and deleting. I’m trying to return it to a place where I can write and reflect, not just manage a maze.</p>

<p>To balance things out, I started a rewatch of <em>Doctor Who,</em> back to the Ninth Doctor and all the leather-jacket nostalgia. There’s something nice about returning to stories that once felt like home.</p>

<p>And of course, I kept up with my Bible reading schedule. Today’s portion was:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Leviticus 23</strong> About the feasts of the Lord, which were always more than calendar events, they were reminders of who He is.</li>
  <li><strong>Psalm 80</strong> A cry for restoration, written from the ache of distance and the hope of mercy.</li>
  <li><strong>Matthew 21</strong> The entry into Jerusalem and the clearing of the temple; a shift in tone and pace as the cross drew closer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not a bad day, really. Nothing flashy. But a quiet kind of progress.</p>
